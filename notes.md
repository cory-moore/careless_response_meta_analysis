## NOTE
- in data coding, split out intstucted response items and bogus items into separate indices

## TODO
- investigate implications of the above modification on the data
  - one implication is how cr types are grouped/created 
  - more obviously, how data is coded - new type of indice
  - might need to only update the codebook (?) because I think the functions refer to the codebook to label the indices
