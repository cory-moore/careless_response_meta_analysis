## Pooling careless responding rates
A random effects model can be appropriate for pooling the estimates of a base rate or a proportion in a meta-analysis, even if the proportion variable accounts for the prevalence of careless responding.

The random effects model assumes that the true effect size can vary across studies due to differences in study design, population characteristics, or other factors. In a meta-analysis of proportions, the between-study heterogeneity can be due to differences in the prevalence of careless responding across studies, as well as differences in the measurement instruments, sampling methods, or other study characteristics.

By accounting for the between-study heterogeneity, the random effects model provides a more conservative estimate of the overall effect size and incorporates the uncertainty in the between-study variability. This can be especially important when the studies included in the meta-analysis are heterogeneous or when the sample size of individual studies is small.

However, it is important to note that the choice of the meta-analysis model should be guided by the nature of the data and the research question, and the appropriateness of the random effects model should be evaluated in light of the available evidence and the assumptions underlying the statistical models. It is recommended to consult a statistician or meta-analysis expert to help you select the appropriate method and interpret the results.
