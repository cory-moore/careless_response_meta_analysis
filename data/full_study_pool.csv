However, little guidance exists in the published literature regarding techniques for detecting careless responses. Previously several potential approaches have been suggested for identifying careless respondents via indices computed from the data, yet almost no prior work has examined the relationships among these indicators or the types of data patterns identified by each. In 2 studies, we examined several methods for identifying careless responses, including (a) special items designed to detect careless response, (b) response consistency indices formed from responses to typical survey items, (c) multivariate outlier analysis, (d) response time, and (e) self-reported diligence. Results indicated that there are two distinct patterns of careless response (random and nonrandom) and that different indices are needed to identify these different response patterns. We also found that approximately 10%–12% of undergraduates completing a lengthy survey for course credit were identified as careless responders. In Study 2, we simulated data with known random response patterns to determine the efficacy of several indicators of careless response. We found that the nature of the data strongly influenced the efficacy of the indices to identify careless responses. Recommendations include using identified rather than anonymous responses, incorporating instructed response items before data collection, as well as computing consistency indices and multivariate outlier analysis to ensure high-quality data.

Invalid data can be present in such data collections for a number of reasons. One reason is careless or insufficient effort (C/IE) responding. The past decade has seen a rise in research on techniques to detect and remove these data before normal analysis (Huang, Curran, Keeney, Poposki, & DeShon, 2012; Johnson, 2005; Meade & Craig, 2012). The rigorous use of these techniques is valuable tool for the removal of error that can impact survey results (Huang, Liu, & Bowling, 2015). This research has encompassed a number of sub-fields of psychology, and this paper aims to integrate different perspectives into a review and assessment of current techniques, an introduction of new techniques, and a generation of recommendations for practical use.

The current article, however, illustrates how and when the presence of IER can produce a systematic bias that inflates observed correlations between substantive measures. Noting that inattentive responses as a whole generally congregate around the midpoint of a Likert scale, we propose that Mattentive, defined as the mean score of attentive respondents on a substantive measure, will be negatively related to IER’s confounding effect on substantive measures (i.e., correlations between IER and a given substantive measure will become less positive [or more negative] as Mattentive increases). Results from a personality questionnaire (Study 1) and a simulation (Study 2) consistently support the hypothesized confounding influence of IER. Using an employee sample (Study 3), we demonstrated how IER can confound bivariate relationships between substantive measures. Together, these studies indicate that IER can inflate the strength of observed relationships when scale means depart from the scale midpoints, resulting in an inflated Type I error rate. This challenges the traditional view that IER attenuates observed bivariate correlations. These findings highlight situations where IER may be a methodological nuisance, while underscoring the need for survey administrators and researchers to deter and detect IER in surveys. The current article serves as a wake-up call for researchers and practitioners to more closely examine IER in their data.

One of the biggest threats to this method of online data collection however is the prevalence of careless responders who can significantly affect data quality. The aims of this preregistered systematic review and meta-analysis were: (a) to examine the prevalence of screening for careless responding in crowdsourced alcohol-related studies; (b) to examine the pooled prevalence of careless responding; and (c) to identify any potential moderators of careless responding across studies. Our review identified 96 eligible studies (∼126,130 participants), of which 51 utilized at least one measure of careless responding, 53.2%, 95% CI [42.7%–63.3%]; ∼75,334 participants. Of these, 48 reported the number of participants identified by careless responding method(s) and the pooled prevalence rate was ∼11.7%, 95% CI [7.6%–16.5%]. Studies using the MTurk platform identified more careless responders compared to other platforms, and the number of careless response items was positively associated with prevalence rates. The most common measure of careless responding was an attention check question, followed by implausible response times. We suggest that researchers plan for such attrition when crowdsourcing participants and provide practical recommendations for handling and reporting careless responding in alcohol research.

It is therefore very important to detect such response behavior. The most frequently encountered type of careless response behavior is back random responding (BRR). Literature suggests that BRR is challenging to detect, with reported power of detection around .5 or lower. Change point analysis (CPA), which is a widely used statistical process control method, can be applied to item response data to detect if aberrant behavior exists in a response pattern. Existing CPA methods, however, may not be suitable for detecting BRR, because the change may not be directional. In this article we propose a weighted-residual-based CPA procedure to detect BRR behavior. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated in a comprehensive simulation study and compared against 3 existing CPA methods. Results indicated that the proposed residual-based CPA procedure can detect BRR behavior with high power for tests of 20 items or longer, while keeping the Type-I error rate well under control. Compared with the 3 existing CPA methods, it leads to comparable empirical Type-I error but a gain in power of 17%–42%. An empirical study further illustrated the utility of the proposed method to detect BRR with a real dataset. Implications of the proposed method, its limitations, as well as future directions are provided at the end.

Extending prior research, we examine the validity of the infrequency approach to detecting IER and assess participant reactions to such an approach. Design/Methodology/Approach: Two online surveys (Studies 1 and 2) completed by employed undergraduates were utilized to assess the validity of the infrequency approach. An on-line survey of paid participants (Study 3) and a paper-and-pencil survey in an organization (Study 4) were conducted to evaluate participant reactions, using random assignment into survey conditions that either did or did not contain infrequency items. Findings: Studies 1 and 2 provided evidence for the reliability, unidimensionality, and criterion-related validity of the infrequency scales. Study 3 and Study 4 showed that surveys that contained infrequency items did not lead to more negative reactions than did surveys that did not contain such items. Implications: The current findings provide evidence of the effectiveness and feasibility of the infrequency approach for detecting IER, supporting its application in low-stakes organizational survey contexts. Originality/Value: The current studies provide a more in-depth examination of the infrequency approach to IER detection than had been done in prior research. In particular, the evaluation of participant reactions to infrequency scales represents a novel contribution to the IER literature.

Despite their widespread use, little research has empirically tested the impact of attention checks on scale validity. In fact, because attention checks can induce a more deliberative mindset in survey respondents, they may change the way respondents answer survey questions, posing a threat to scale validity. In two studies, we tested this hypothesis (N = 816). We examined whether common attention checks—instructed-response items (Study 1) and an instructional manipulation check (Study 2)—impact responses to a well-validated management scale. Results showed no evidence that they affect scale validity, both in reported scale means and tests of measurement invariance.

Many journals and reviewers view manipulation checks favorably, and they are widely reported in prestigious journals. However, the prototypical manipulation check is a verbal (rather than behavioral) measure that always appears at the same point in the procedure (rather than its order being varied to assess order effects). Embedding such manipulation checks within an experiment comes with problems. While we conceptualize manipulation checks as measures, they can also act as interventions which initiate new processes that would otherwise not occur. The default assumption that manipulation checks do not affect experimental conclusions is unwarranted. They may amplify, undo, or interact with the effects of a manipulation. Further, the use of manipulation checks in mediational analyses does not rule out confounding variables, as any unmeasured variables that correlate with the manipulation check may still drive the relationship. Alternatives such as non-verbal and behavioral measures as manipulation checks and pilot testing are less problematic. Reviewers should view manipulation checks more critically, and authors should explore alternative methods to ensure the effectiveness of manipulations.",2018,9/16/22 13:57,9/16/22 13:57,9/16/22 13:57,,,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/TZQ4PPB3/Hauser et al. - 2018 - Are Manipulation Checks Necessary.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead, we recommend using multiple items to measure attention. We also show that Screener passage correlates with politically relevant characteristics, which limits the generalizability of studies that exclude failers. We conclude that attention is best measured using multiple Screener questions and that studies using Screeners can balance the goals of internal and external validity by presenting results conditional on different levels of attention.",2014,9/16/22 14:09,10/5/22 22:40,9/16/22 14:09,739-753,,3,58,,,Separating the Shirkers from the Workers?,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ajps.12081,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/SQG5JU4D/Berinsky et al_2014_Separating the Shirkers from the Workers.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/GNNAHQWL/Berinsky et al. - 2014 - Separating the Shirkers from the Workers Making S.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/XH4L62T3/ajps.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review synthesizes the careless responding literature to provide a comprehensive understanding of careless responding and ways to prevent, identify, report, and clean careless responding from data sets. Further, we include recommendations for different levels of screening for careless responses.

A rich body of methods aiming at its detection has been developed.  Most of these methods can detect only specific types of C/IER patterns. However, typically different types of C/IER patterns occur within one data set and need to be accounted for. We present a model-based approach for detecting manifold manifestations of C/IER at once. This is achieved by leveraging response time (RT) information available from computer-administered questionnaires and integrating theoretical considerations on C/IER with recent psychometric modeling approaches. The approach a) takes the specifics of attentive response behavior on questionnaires into account by incorporating the distance–difficulty hypothesis, b) allows for attentiveness to vary on the screen-by-respondent level, c) allows for respondents with different trait and speed levels to differ in their attentiveness, and d) at once deals with various response patterns arising from C/IER. The approach makes use of item-level RTs. An adapted version for aggregated RTs is presented that supports screening for C/IER behavior on the respondent level. Parameter recovery is investigated in a simulation study. The approach is illustrated in an empirical example, comparing different RT measures and contrasting the proposed model-based procedure against indicator-based multiple-hurdle approaches.",6/1/22,9/22/22 21:15,10/21/22 2:30,7/19/22 16:01,593-619,,2,87,,Psychometrika,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,; ; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/X7H39RF2/Ulitzsch et al_2022_A Response-Time-Based Latent Response Mixture Model for Identifying and.pdf,https://proxying.lib.ncsu.edu/index.php?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=psyh&AN=2022-12011-001&site=ehost-live&scope=site&scope=cite; https://proxying.lib.ncsu.edu/index.php?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=psyh&AN=2022-12011-001&site=ehost-live&scope=site&scope=cite,,careless responses; data screening; item response theory; Item Response Theory; mixture modeling; Mixture Modeling; Reaction Time; response times; Responses; Statistical Data; Surveys,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results do not support the use of warning statements to reduce IER covertly, overtly, or overall. Although slightly more university participants were flagged for IER for two of five IER indices, the remaining three indices did not differ between samples.

Different approaches have been proposed to detect aberrant responses such as probing questions that directly assess test-taking behavior (e.g., bogus items), auxiliary or paradata (e.g., response times), or data-driven statistical techniques (e.g., Mahalanobis distance). In the present study, gradient boosted trees, a state-of-the-art machine learning technique, are introduced to identify careless respondents. The performance of the approach was compared with established techniques previously described in the literature (e.g., statistical outlier methods, consistency analyses, and response pattern functions) using simulated data and empirical data from a web-based study, in which diligent versus careless response behavior was experimentally induced. In the simulation study, gradient boosting machines outperformed traditional detection mechanisms in flagging aberrant responses. However, this advantage did not transfer to the empirical study. In terms of precision, the results of both traditional and the novel detection mechanisms were unsatisfactory, although the latter incorporated response times as additional information. The comparison between the results of the simulation and the online study showed that responses in real-world settings seem to be much more erratic than can be expected from the simulation studies.

Using paradata, which are data collected apart from reactionary data, is one of the potential tools that can help to screen for problematic responses in web-based surveys. One of the most promising forms of paradata is the movement, or trajectory, of the cursor in making a response. This study presented correlations between such indices and constructed components representing their common variance. Moreover, it provided an interpretation and validation of these components (interpreted as indicators of complexity, hesitancy, and regularity), among others, by correlating them with previously known indices of careless responding.

Our question is: how do different modes of data collection—paper/pencil, computer/web-based, and smartphone—affect participants’ diligence vs. “careless responding” tendencies and, thus, data quality? Results from prior studies suggest that different data collection modes produce a comparable prevalence of careless responding tendencies. However, as technology develops and data are collected with increasingly diversified populations, this question needs to be readdressed and taken further. The present research examined the effect of survey mode on careless responding in a repeated-measures design with data from three different samples. First, in a sample of working adults from China, we found that participants were slightly more careless when completing computer/web-based survey materials than in paper/pencil mode. Next, in a German student sample, participants were slightly more careless when completing the paper/pencil mode compared to the smartphone mode.

Does data quality suffer for scales positioned near the end of a lengthy questionnaire?,Journal of Business and Psychology,,0889-3268,10.1007/s10869-021-09787-8,,"Research questionnaires frequently include dozens—if not hundreds—of self-report items. Lengthy questionnaires, however, are often a necessity. In some cases, they are needed to assess the many variables found in a complex model; in other cases, they are the result of the inclusion of a single lengthy measure. This raises an important question: Do participants provide accurate responses to measures positioned at the end of a lengthy questionnaire? One possibility is that participants experience fatigue during questionnaire completion, leading them to engage in careless responding, and thus compromising the accuracy of their responses. Another possibility is that even the longest research questionnaires are generally too short to evoke participant fatigue. This latter possibility suggests that participants are largely able to maintain their attention while completing most questionnaires. Given the lack of clarity on this issue, we conducted two experiments (Study 1 N = 244; Study 2 N = 461) in which we randomly assigned each participant to complete a block of target scales at either the beginning or the end of a lengthy (> 300-item) questionnaire. Each participant also recruited an informant who provided reports of the participant’s personality, attitudes, and behaviors. These informant data allowed us to examine the effects of the experimental manipulation on the target scales’ convergent and criterion-related validity. The findings of both studies indicated that the target scales performed similarly across the two conditions. Given the ubiquity of lengthy questionnaires, these findings have far-reaching practical implications.

The trend has resulted in significant interest in the use of panel samples for the examination of behavioral and substance addictions. One newer panel platform, Qualtrics, has seen an increase in usage in recent years despite lack of research examining the validity of Qualtrics-produced data for addictive behaviors. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the validity of Qualtrics-obtained data for the most recently classified behavioral addiction—video gaming. The evaluation compared a Qualtrics-recruited video gamers sample (n = 586) to traditional community (n = 108) and student (n = 217) samples on demographics and key outcomes relevant to gaming disorder researchers (average playtime, frequency of gaming, and gaming disorder risk scores) to evaluate the generalizability of Qualtrics panel data. The results revealed that Qualtrics samples were comparable to a traditionally recruited community sample, but different from a student sample on gaming frequency (p p p = .01), with some differences in demographics between the all three sources of recruitment. The findings suggest that Qualtrics may provide a suitable method of convenience panel recruitment, generalizable to the broader North American community, for research examining video gaming behaviors and gaming disorder.

We utilized IRTrees, a statistical method for modeling response styles, to examine the relationship between IER and response styles. To capture the wide range of IER metrics available, we employed several forms of IER assessment in our analyses and generated IER factors based on the type of IER being detected. Our results indicated an overall modest relationship between IER and response styles, which varied depending on the type of IER metric being considered or type of scale being evaluated.

Not only the analytic approach but also the operationalizations of key variables were left unconstrained and up to individual analysts. For instance, analysts could choose to operationalize status as job title, institutional ranking, citation counts, or some combination. To maximize transparency regarding the process by which analytic choices are made, the analysts used a platform we developed called DataExplained to justify both preferred and rejected analytic paths in real time. Analyses lacking sufficient detail, reproducible code, or with statistical errors were excluded, resulting in 29 analyses in the final sample.

A Boba multiverse analysis demonstrates that decisions about how to operationalize variables explain variability in outcomes above and beyond statistical choices (e.g., covariates).

Data were collected from two samples (N = 470 and N = 822) where participants rated a large number of items and completed the HEXACO-PI-R. The subjective and objective indicators of data quality were related to five HEXACO traits—in particular conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness—and were correlated in the expected directions.

Additionally, EMA enables researchers to acquire longitudinal data without the need for multiple lab visits. As the use of EMA in research increases, so too does the necessity of determining what constitutes valid or careless individual EMA responses to ensure validity and replicability of findings. Currently, EMA studies solely consider the response rate of a participant for exclusion. Yet, other features of an assessment can help to determine whether a response is careless or implausible. Here, we examined over 18,000 EMA text message responses of individual affect items to derive a data-driven model of what constitutes a “careless response.” Results from this study indicate that an overly fast time to complete items (≤ 1 s), an overly narrow within assessment response variance (SD ≤ 5), and the percentage of items that fall at the mode (≥ 60%) are independent and reliable indicators of a careless response. Excluding careless responses such as these remove implausible positive correlations among psychometric antonyms (e.g., relaxed and anxious). Further, by identifying and removing careless responses, we also identify careless responders, participants who could be removed from group analyses. We use these results to develop and introduce an R package, EMAeval, so EMA researchers may similarly identify careless responses and responders either online during data collection or posthoc, after data collection has completed.

To obtain results that reflect a fact, detecting satisficing and excluding the responses with satisficing from the analysis targets are required. One of the devised methods detects satisficing by adding questions that check violations of instructions and inconsistencies. However, this approach may cause respondents to lose their motivation and prompt them to satisficing. Additionally, a deep learning model that automatically answers these questions was reported. This threatens the reliability of the conventional method. To detect careless responses without inserting such screening questions, machine learning (ML) detection using data obtained from answer results was attempted in a previous study, with a detection rate of 55.6%, which is not sufficient from the viewpoint of practicality. Therefore, we hypothesized that a supervised ML model with a higher detection rate could be constructed by using on-screen answering behavior as features. However, (1) no existing questionnaire system can record on-screen answering behavior and (2) even if the answering behavior can be recorded, it is unclear which answering behavior features are associated with satisficing. We developed an answering behavior recording plug-in for LimeSurvey, an online questionnaire system used all over the world, and collected a large amount of data (from 5,692 people) in Japan. Then, a variety of features were examined and generated from answering behavior, and we constructed ML models to detect careless responses. We call this detection method the ML-ABS (ML-based answering behavior scale). Evaluation by cross-validation demonstrated that the detection rate for careless responses was 85.9%, which is much higher than the previous ML method. Among the various features we proposed, we found that reselecting the Likert scale and scrolling particularly contributed to the detection of careless responses.",2021,9/22/22 21:15,10/5/22 23:03,,53205-53218,,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,Conference Name: IEEE Access,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/B3ILF3PB/Gogami et al_2021_Detection of Careless Responses in Online Surveys Using Answering Behavior on.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/CXCV78UU/9387296.html,,,Answering behavior; Approximation algorithms; careless response; Data models; Deep learning; Feature extraction; Licenses; online questionnaire; Psychology; Reliability; satisficing; smartphone; supervised machine learning; touchscreen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted three studies (total N = 1,056) to examine the page time index's construct validity. Across these studies, we found that page time converged highly with other IER indices, that it was sensitive to an experimental manipulation warning participants to respond carefully, and that it predicted the extent to which participants were unable to recognize item content. We also found that page time's validity was superior to that of total completion time and that the two-seconds-per-item rule yielded a construct-valid page time score for items of various word lengths.

Careless responding typically arises in low-stakes settings (e.g., participating in a study for course credit) where some respondents are not motivated to respond in a conscientious manner to the items. In contrast, in high-stakes assessments (e.g., prehire assessments), because of the outcomes associated with their responses, respondents are motivated to present themselves in as favorable a light as possible and, thus,may respond dishonestly in an effort to accomplish this objective. In this article, we draw a distinction between the lazy respondent, which we associate with careless responding, and the dishonest respondent, which we associate with response distortion. We then seek to answer the following questions for both careless responding and response distortion: (a) What is it? (b) Why is it a problem or concern? (c) Why do people engage in it? (d) How pervasive is it? (e) Can and how is it prevented or mitigated? ( f ) How is it detected?

Consequently, the quality of these decisions is contingent upon the quality of survey responses. Therefore, the presence of careless responders in online surveys is of concern to both research and practitioners alike. Though many metrics of careless responding have been proposed, they are generally continuous in nature. To date there is little to no research providing a sound basis for choosing a cut score for these metrics, in order to make a final determination to remove a respondent from the data set or not. This study was designed to address this issue by simulating many datasets with careless and careful respondents, and then evaluating a variety of methods to provide a cut score for metrics individually, and as an ensemble. Specifically, I investigated three metrics, namely, longstring, even-odd, and outliers. The results demonstrate the general stability and usefulness of the longstring metric when using a cut score set at .4 standard deviations from the mean. Subsequently computing and cleaning data using the outlier metric with a cut score of .5 standard deviations is also recommended, but at the cost of approximately 30% of careful respondents. Additional best practices for survey design and future research are also discussed.

79VRJD4P,journalArticle,2020,"Marshall, Alyssa D.",Caring more about careless responding: Applying the theory of planned behavior to reduce careless responding on online surveys,Dissertations,,,,,"Careless responding behavior on online surveys is an insidious problem that can distort research findings in concerning and counter-intuitive ways (McGonagle, Huang, & Walsh, 2016). This study aimed to develop practical strategies for reducing careless responding behavior and to provide theoretical support for the notion that careless responding is a planned behavior affected by motivational processes. This study applied the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991) to develop three careless responding interventions. One intervention was targeted at each of the theory's antecedent variables – attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Using a sample of 591 MTurk participants, I examined the interventions' effects on antecedent variables, intentions to respond carefully, and six different measures of careless responding behavior as compared to a control group who received no intervention.Overall, this study found that the theory of planned behavior does explain significant variance in careless responding behavior. This supports the notion that careless responding is a planned behavior affected by motivational processes. Further, this study found that the perceived behavioral control intervention was effective at reducing careless responding on most metrics, though the attitudes and subjective norms interventions were not.

In this comment, we critique this conclusion by highlighting critical problems with the experimental manipulation used. Specifically, Goldammer et al.’s manipulations only encouraged overly inconsistent, or random, responding and thus did not induce the full range of careless response behavior that is present in natural careless responding. As such, it is unsurprising that metrics designed to detect overly consistent responding did not appear to be effective. Because the full range of careless behavior was not induced, Goldammer et al.’s study cannot address the utility of longstring or similar metrics.

Our aim was to investigate the extent to which careless and insufficient effort responding contributes to the biasing of data. We performed analyses of dimensionality, internal structure, and data reliability of four personality scales (extroversion, conscientiousness, stability, and dispositional optimism) in two independent samples. In order to identify careless/insufficient effort (C/IE) respondents, we used a factor mixture model (FMM) designed to detect inconsistencies of response to items with different semantic polarity. The FMM identified between 4.4% and 10% of C/IE cases, depending on the scale and the sample examined. In the complete samples, all the theoretical models obtained an unacceptable fit, forcing the rejection of the starting hypothesis and making additional wording factors necessary. In the clean samples, all the theoretical models fitted satisfactorily, and the wording factors practically disappeared. Trait estimates in the clean samples were between 4.5% and 11.8% more accurate than in the complete samples. These results show that a limited amount of C/IE data can lead to a drastic deterioration in the fit of the theoretical model, produce large amounts of spurious variance, raise serious doubts about the dimensionality and internal structure of the data, and reduce the reliability with which the trait scores of all surveyed are estimated.

Meanwhile, the false-positive error rate is close to the nominal level. In addition, item parameter estimation is much improved by iteratively cleansing the calibration sample. The bias in item discrimination and location parameter estimates is substantially reduced. The standard error estimates, which are spuriously small in the presence of careless responses, are corrected by the iterative cleansing procedure.

Careless and inattentive (CI) responding is a confound in survey data that can distort findings and lead to incorrect conclusions. This quantitative study explored CI responding in job analysis studies supporting occupational certification programs and its relationship to survey features, data quality measures, and test content validity. Satisficing theory served as the framework, and secondary analysis of 3 job analysis surveys was undertaken. Results indicated that 9-33% of respondents engaged in CI responding, with the rate differing by CI index used (Mahalanobis distance, long string analysis, or person-total correlation) and by occupation. Each index detected a distinct pattern of carelessness, supporting the use of multiple indices. The indices performed best detecting carelessness in frequency ratings and may not be useful for all job analysis rating scales. Partial support was found for relationships between carelessness and survey features. CI responding had a minimal impact on mean ratings, correlations, and interrater reliability, and had no impact on certification test content outlines. By providing guidance and caution on the use of CI response detection methods with job analysis survey data, this study produced two potential avenues for social change. For practitioners conducting occupational job analyses, the use of CI detection methods can enhance the validity of data used to make certification decisions. For researchers, follow-up studies can yield a more nuanced understanding of the most appropriate use of these methods in the job analysis context.

The purpose of this article is to assess and explain the amount of CR at the individual and country level. In our study, individual CR (measured by indices using a short Big 5 personality questionnaire) correlated with education level and personality traits. In addition, using a sample of 8,320 participants from 34 countries, CR at the country level was investigated and it was strongly correlated with the cultural dimensions: human development, individualism, gender inequality, and power distance. CR can be seen as a powerful predictor of differences between countries. Finally, a comparison between CR and response styles (extreme and midpoint answers, acquiescence, and socially desirable responses) was conducted. CR and response styles showed some overlap, but loaded on different factors. CR is compatible with extreme answers, midpoint answers, and acquiescence, but different from social desirability.

To address these possible antecedents, this study investigated whether survey proctoring deterred careless response in an undergraduate sample by reducing environmental distractions. The study randomly assigned respondents to one of three proctoring conditions: remote online un‐proctored, remote online virtually proctored, and in‐person classroom proctored. Data quality was examined via nine careless response indicators. Analyses indicated that proctor presence had effects on a small number of careless response indicators. Virtually proctored participants performed better than un‐proctored participants on one of nine careless response indicators, and in‐person proctored participants performed better on two careless response indicators compared to un‐proctored participants. Environmental distraction fully mediated the relationship between in‐person proctor presence and self‐reported diligence. Implications for survey administration are discussed.

We tested each measure of careless responding on its own, simultaneously with other predictors, and with Bayesian analyses. In all three samples, there were strong and consistent effects such that more careful participants made fewer overall errors on the IAT; however, careless responding did not consistently predict implicit and explicit attitudes formed toward novel social groups.

We investigated validity indices most appropriate for detecting careless responding in routine outcome monitoring (ROM) in mental health-care. First, we reviewed indices proposed in previous research for their suitability in ROM. Next, we evaluated six selected indices using data of the Brief Symptom Inventory and the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire from 3,483 outpatients. Simulations showed that for typical ROM scales the Lmax index, Mahalanobis distance, and inter-item standard deviation may be too strongly confounded with the latent trait value to compare careless responding across patients with different symptom severity. Application of two different classification methods to the validity indices did not converge in similar prevalence estimates of careless responding. Finally, results suggest that careless respondingdoes not have a substantial biasing effect on scale-score statistics. We recommend the lpz person-fit index to screen for random careless responding in large ROM data sets. However, additional research should further investigate methods for detecting repetitive responding in typical ROM data and assess whether there are specific circumstances in which simpler validity statistics or direct screening methods perform similarly as the lpz index.

In low-stakes measures, inattentive or careless responding can be especially problematic. A variety of a priori and post hoc methods exist for detecting these aberrant response patterns. Previous research indicates that nonparametric person-fit statistics tend to be the most accurate post hoc method for detecting inattentive responding on measures with dichotomous outcomes. This study investigated the accuracy and impact on model fit of parametric and nonparametric person-fit statistics in detecting inattentive responding with polytomous response scales. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was used to determine the accuracy of each detection metric, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) fit indices were used to examine the impact of using person-fit statistics to identify inattentive respondents. ROC analysis showed the nonparametric HT statistic offered the most area under the curve when predicting a proxy for inattentive responding. The CFA fit indices showed the impact of using the person-fit statistics largely depends on the purpose (and cutoff) for using the person-fit statistics. Implications for using person-fit statistics to identify inattentive responders are discussed further.

In the present study, we compared two methods of detecting random responding with infrequency items: a zero-tolerance threshold versus a threshold that balances classification error rates. The results showed that a traditional zero-tolerance approach, on average, screens data that are less indicative of careless responding than those screened by the error-balancing approach.

The floodlight detection of careless respondents method is the first systematic approach to calculate a cut-off value for response time, which distinguishes careless respondents from careful respondents. According to the results of floodlight detection of careless respondents, the percentage of careless respondents was 59.8%, which is little higher than the percentage of careless respondents calculated through Instructional Manipulation Check (40.7%) and bogus item (44.2%).

This study addresses questions about the impact of screening techniques on data and statistical analyses. It also serves an initial attempt to estimate descriptive statistics and graphically display the distributions of popular screening techniques. Data were obtained from an online sample who completed demographic items and measures of character strengths (N = 307). Screening indices demonstrate minimal overlap and differ in the number of participants flagged. Existing cutoff scores for most screening techniques seem appropriate, but cutoff values for consistency-based indices may be too liberal. Screens differ in the extent to which they impact survey results. The use of screening techniques can impact inter-item correlations, inter-scale correlations, reliability estimates, and statistical results. While data screening can improve the quality and trustworthiness of data, screening techniques are not interchangeable. Researchers and practitioners should be aware of the differences between data screening techniques and apply appropriate screens for their survey characteristics and study design. Low-impact direct and unobtrusive screens such as self-report indicators, bogus items, instructed items, longstring, individual response variability, and response time are relatively simple to administer and analyze. The fact that data screening can influence the statistical results of a study demonstrates that low-quality data can distort hypothesis testing in organizational research and practice.

The present simulations examine two forms of IER, straightlining (SL) and random responding (RR), in an attempt to determine whether the presence of these response patterns have differential impacts on data. In three studies, we explore the combined effects of extreme SL and RR, the effects of full and partial RR, and the effects of full and partial SL on scale characteristics such as inter-item correlations, alpha, and component structure. We also explore how various IER response distributions may influence these statistics. Empirical results demonstrate a tendency for SL to increase and RR to decrease the magnitude of inter-item correlations, alpha, and the first component eigenvalue. Results also indicate that the impact of SL may be more pronounced than the impact of RR in the organisational sciences.

Inconsistent responding may be a result of a number of factors including inattentiveness, reading or comprehension difficulties, and cognitive impairment. Many stand-alone personality scales used in applied and research settings, however, do not include validity indicators to help identify inattentive response patterns. Using multiple archival samples, the current study describes the development of an inconsistent responding scale for the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (TriPM; Patrick, 2010), a widely used self-report measure of psychopathy. We first identified pairs of correlated TriPM items in a derivation sample (N = 2,138) and then created a total score based on the sum of the absolute value of the differences for each item pair. The resulting scale, the Triarchic Assessment Procedure for Inconsistent Responding (TAPIR), strongly differentiated between genuine TriPM protocols and randomly generated TriPM data (N = 1,000), as well as between genuine protocols and those in which 50% of the original data were replaced with random item responses. TAPIR scores demonstrated fairly consistent patterns of association with some theoretically relevant correlates (e.g., inconsistency scales embedded in other personality inventories), although not others (e.g., measures of conscientiousness) across our cross-validation samples. Tentative TAPIR cut scores that may discriminate between attentively and carelessly completed protocols are presented.

A total of 204 undergraduates completed an online survey with several self-report measures (the Creative Achievement Questionnaire, the Biographical Inventory of Creative Behavior, and the Aesthetic Fluency Scale). Many metrics of inattentiveness were included, such as directed response items, self-reported attentiveness, and scales to catch inconsistent and patterned responses. The Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding measured facets of social desirability. We found high rates of inattentive responding. A latent class analysis indicated that around 25% of the sample was potentially inattentive, and inattentive respondents received higher scores on the creativity and arts scales. Excluding problematic participants increased the effect sizes of interest, consistent with the coarsening effect of careless participants. Social desirability, in contrast, had essentially no relationship with the creativity and arts scales. These findings suggest that social desirability is probably less of a problem than researchers fear, but that inattentiveness is an underappreciated threat.

Legitimate power, role expectations, and reactions to moral objection in organizations",Journal of Applied Psychology,,1939-1854,10.1037/apl0000094,,"Organization members who engage in “moral objection” by taking a principled stand against ethically questionable activities help to prevent such activities from persisting. Unfortunately, research suggests that they also may be perceived as less warm (i.e., pleasant, nice) than members who comply with ethically questionable procedures. In this article, we draw on role theory to explore how legitimate power influences observers’ responses to moral objection. We argue that individuals expect those high in legitimate power to engage in moral objection, but expect those low in legitimate power to comply with ethically questionable practices. We further propose that these contrasting role expectations influence the extent to which moral objectors are perceived as warm and subjected to social sanctions (i.e., insults, pressure, unfriendly behavior). We test our predictions with 3 experiments. Study 1, which draws on participants’ prior workplace experiences, supports the first section of our mediated moderation model in which the negative association between an actor’s moral objection (vs. compliance) and observers’ warmth perceptions is weaker when the actor is high rather than low in legitimate power and this effect is mediated by observers’ met role expectations. Study 2, an online experiment featuring a biased hiring task, reveals that the warmth perceptions fostered by the Behavior × Legitimate Power interaction influence observers’ social sanctioning intentions. Finally, Study 3, a laboratory experiment which exposes participants to unethical behavior in a virtual team task, replicates Study 2’s findings and extends the results to actual as well as intended social sanctions.

We present a rationale for why IER is of particular importance to Work and Organisational Health Psychology (WOHP) researchers. We also demonstrate its biasing effects using several variables of interest to WOHP researchers (perceived work ability, negative affectivity, perceived disability, work–safety tension, accident/injury frequencies, and experienced and instigated incivility) in two datasets. As expected, IER was significantly correlated with the focal study variables. We also found some evidence that hypothesised bivariate correlations between these variables were inflated when IER respondents were included. Corroborating IER's potential confounding role, we further found significant declines in the magnitude of the hypothesised bivariate correlations after partialling out IER. In addition, we found evidence for biasing (under-estimation) effects for predictors not contaminated by IER in multiple regression models where some predictors and the outcome were both contaminated by IER. We call for WOHP researchers to routinely discourage IER from occurring in their surveys, screen for IER prior to analyzing survey data, and establish a standard practice for handling IER cases.",2016,9/22/22 21:15,10/22/22 13:14,7/19/22 15:04,287-321,,2,65,,,Insufficient Effort Survey Responding,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/apps.12058,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/IZLWGQQ2/McGonagle et al_2016_Insufficient Effort Survey Responding.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/UVN8DPY3/apps.html; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/5EJSCP3D/apps.html,,,Business Organizations; Health Care Psychology; insufficient effort responding; Occupational Health; Occupational Safety; surveys; Surveys; work & organizational health psychology; work safety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early detection of careless responses in self-report questionnaires may reduce error, but little guidance exists in the literature regarding techniques for detecting such careless or random responses in self-report questionnaires. Purpose of the Study: The purpose of this study was to examine whether the respondent‟s goodness-of-fit test score (RGF) can be used to indicate careless responses in completing self-report questionnaires. It is hypothesized that there is a significant difference of RGF between careless responses and true responses and that RGF of careless responses is higher than RGF for true responses. Method: An experimental research design that made use of a self-reported questionnaire was conducted with 205 respondents divided into two groups. The first group responded truthfully to the questionnaire while the second group responded carelessly to the questionnaire. The validity and reliability of the questionnaire had been tested. One hundred and eighty five respondents were selected as the group of true responses, while another 20 respondents comprised the group of careless responses. T-test of independent sample was used to evaluate the different RGF among true responses and careless responses. Findings: After comparing the mean scores of RGF between careless responses and true responses, a significant difference was found. The frequency distribution of true responses tends to be normally distributed while the existence of careless responses creates a skewed distribution to the right. The RGF of careless responses is higher than the RGF of true responses. Conclusion and Recommendations: RGF may be used as an indicator of respondent‟s careless responses in self-report questionnaires in which more accurate data are expected. Social science research that makes use of self-report questionnaire in measuring affective domain may compute RGF to determine whether careless responses exist.

The quality of data gathered from self-reported measures is heavily dependent upon respondents’ comprehension and motivation to self-disclose accurately. Distinct from faking (i.e. responding deceptively), careless responding is characterized by participants’ effortless or inattentive response behavior. Originally coined random responding, it is the tendency to respond to items without attention to content. It is generally assumed that such responses are truly random and can be treated empirically as such; however, numerous scholars have argued that unmotivated response styles can be patterned and/or consistent. Careless responding has also been conceptualized as a subset of a much larger concept known as invalid responding. As definitions inform the development of techniques to identify problematic responses, such inconsistencies across the literature may explain why various rates are reported across studies.

Whereas previous studies have focused on IER as a methodological nuisance, the current studies examined IER as a substantive variable. Specifically, we hypothesized that IER is a reflection of enduring individual differences. In Study 1, we found that IER displayed rank-order consistency over the course of 13 months; in Studies 2 and 3, we found that IER displayed rank-order consistency across multiple research situations; in Study 4, we found that acquaintance-reported conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion, and emotional stability were each negatively related to IER; and in Study 5, we found that IER was related to college grade point average and class absences.

While there are advantages to online surveys, this mode of administration comes with its own set of challenges. Survey respondents may engage in careless responding (i.e. insufficient effort responding or satisficing) by intentionally or unintentionally responding in a manner that does not accurately reflect their true sentiments. Careless responding can create psychometric problems even after correctly removing careless respondents (i.e. mischievous responders). This study aimed to improve survey methodology by preventing careless responding. Using a 3 × 3 between-subjects experimental design, we manipulated both virtual presence (none, animated shape, and virtual human) and type of instructions (anonymous, warning, and feedback). Indicators of careless responding were the dependent variables. Results showed that beyond characteristics of survey items, survey design elements can prevent careless responding. The effects of interventions differed by type of careless responding. Instructions, and the interaction of instructions and virtual presence significantly reduced careless responding, but not virtual presence alone. Virtual human presence increased the salience of instructions. Although currently effective, instructions warning of punitive consequences may create difficulty in recruiting participants. Future research should continue investigating non-aversive ways to prevent careless responding on Internet-based surveys.

The lack of guidance on this issue often leads reviewers and journal editors to rely on simple rules of thumb, myth, and tradition for judgments about sampling, which promotes the unnecessary and counterproductive characterization of sampling strategies as universally “good” or “bad.” Such oversimplification, especially by journal editors and reviewers, slows the progress of the social sciences by considering legitimate data sources to be categorically unacceptable. Instead, we argue that sampling is better understood in methodological terms of range restriction and omitted variables bias. This considered approach has far-reaching implications because in industrial–organizational (I-O) psychology, as in most social sciences, virtually all of the samples are convenience samples. Organizational samples are not gold standard research sources; instead, they are merely a specific type of convenience sample with their own positive and negative implications for validity. This fact does not condemn the science of I-O psychology but does highlight the need for more careful consideration of how and when a finding may generalize based on the particular mix of validity-related affordances provided by each sample source that might be used to investigate a particular research question.

Given such potential adverse impacts and the broad use of self-report measures when appraising addictions and addictive behavior, the detection of C/RR can reduce error substantially. Based on earlier research using a video game questionnaire as an exemplar, we cross-validated promising items for detecting C/RR and developed an expanded set of items, in this case using an Internet questionnaire to examine efficacy and generalization. Research participants were instructed to complete the questionnaire in standard fashion (i.e., cooperatively) or to adopt either a careless or random response set. Careless and random responders often obtained elevated mean questionnaire scores. Most items for detecting careless or random responding demonstrated significant differences across groups, and combinations of items showed high levels of accuracy, particularly in detecting random responders. Results suggest that a relatively small number of items, which might only add a minute or two to questionnaire completion time, can detect the great majority of random responders and most careless responders.

As use of MTurk has grown, so have questions from behavioral researchers about its participants, reliability, and low compensation. In this article, we review recent research about MTurk and compare MTurk participants with community and student samples on a set of personality dimensions and classic decision-making biases. Across two studies, we find many similarities between MTurk participants and traditional samples, but we also find important differences. For instance, MTurk participants are less likely to pay attention to experimental materials, reducing statistical power. They are more likely to use the Internet to find answers, even with no incentive for correct responses. MTurk participants have attitudes about money that are different from a community sample's attitudes but similar to students' attitudes. Finally, MTurk participants are less extraverted and have lower self-esteem than other participants, presenting challenges for some research domains. Despite these differences, MTurk participants produce reliable results consistent with standard decision-making biases: they are present biased, risk-averse for gains, risk-seeking for losses, show delay/expedite asymmetries, and show the certainty effect—with almost no significant differences in effect sizes from other samples. We conclude that MTurk offers a highly valuable opportunity for data collection and recommend that researchers using MTurk (1) include screening questions that gauge attention and language comprehension; (2) avoid questions with factual answers; and (3) consider how individual differences in financial and social domains may influence results.

In each study, adolescent respondents were asked whether they were telling the truth and paying attention in answering survey questions. In Study 1 (N = 7,801), the prevalence rates of student risk behaviors were significantly lower after inappropriate (invalid) responders were screened out of the sample. In addition, confirmatory and multigroup factor analyses demonstrated significant differences between the factor structures of school climate scales with valid versus invalid responders. In Study 2, student perceptions of school climate were correlated with teacher perceptions in 291 schools. A bootstrap resampling procedure compared the correlations obtained with valid versus invalid responding students in each school and found that valid responders had more positive views of school conditions and produced higher correlations with teacher perceptions. These findings support the value of validity screening items in improving the quality of adolescent survey data.

Random responses to individual items result in nonrandomly distributed inventory-level scores. Therefore, even low base rates of random responding can significantly affect the statistical inferences made from inventory-level data.

The use of bias indicators in applied assessment is predicated on the assumptions that (a) response bias suppresses or moderates the criterion-related validity of substantive psychological indicators and (b) bias indicators are capable of detecting the presence of response bias. To test these assumptions, we reviewed literature comprising investigations in which bias indicators were evaluated as suppressors or moderators of the validity of other indicators. This review yielded only 41 studies across the contexts of personality assessment, workplace variables, emotional disorders, eligibility for disability, and forensic populations. In the first two contexts, there were enough studies to conclude that support for the use of bias indicators was weak. Evidence suggesting that random or careless responding may represent a biasing influence was noted, but this conclusion was based on a small set of studies. Several possible causes for failure to support the overall hypothesis were suggested, including poor validity of bias indicators, the extreme base rate of bias, and the adequacy of the criteria. In the other settings, the yield was too small to afford viable conclusions. Although the absence of a consensus could be used to justify continued use of bias indicators in such settings, false positives have their costs, including wasted effort and adverse impact. Despite many years of research, a sufficient justification for the use of bias indicators in applied settings remains elusive.",2010-05,9/22/22 21:15,10/5/22 23:05,,450-470,,3,136,,Psychol Bull,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 20438146,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/TAB9YTWE/McGrath et al_2010_Evidence for response bias as a source of error variance in applied assessment.pdf; ; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/GBIHJN2L/doiLanding.html; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/Z28GAMAJ/2010-07936-009.html,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20438146,,Bias; Error of Measurement; Humans; Measurement; Personnel Selection; Psychological Tests; Psychology; Psychometrics; Response Bias; Test Validity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, no studies have investigated whether measurement equivalence exists between Internet data collection and data collection using the conventional paper-and-pencil method in organisational surveys which include a large number of countries. This paper examined the measurement equivalence of a truly global organisational survey across Internet and paper-and-pencil survey administrations. Data from an organisational survey in 16 countries (N = 52,461) across the globe were used to assess the measurement equivalence of an organisational climate measure within each country in which the survey was administered. The empirical data provided strong indications which support the measurement equivalence of the multi-item survey instrument across Internet and paper-and-pencil surveys in virtually all countries in which the survey was conducted. These findings suggest that merging data obtained through Internet and paper-and-pencil data administration in a particular country is legitimate as no evidence was found for differential effects across both modes of data collection.

Reliable approaches for detecting C/IER aid in increasing the validity of inferences being made from survey data. First, once detected, C/IER can be taken into account in data analysis. Second, approaches for detecting C/IER support a better understanding of its occurrence, which facilitates designing surveys that curb the prevalence of C/IER. Previous approaches for detecting C/IER are limited in that they identify C/IER at the aggregate respondent or scale level, thereby hindering investigations of item characteristics evoking C/IER. We propose an explanatory mixture item response theory model that supports identifying and modelling C/IER at the respondent-by-item level, can detect a wide array of C/IER patterns, and facilitates a deeper understanding of item characteristics associated with its occurrence. As the approach only requires raw response data, it is applicable to data from paper-and-pencil and online surveys. The model shows good parameter recovery and can well handle the simultaneous occurrence of multiple types of C/IER patterns in simulated data. The approach is illustrated on a publicly available Big Five inventory data set, where we found later item positions to be associated with higher C/IER probabilities.

The selected indicators were based on bogus, infrequency and inconsistency items, long-string indices and response times. We administered a long (circa 200-item) survey to a convenience sample of psychology undergraduate students and measured the fluctuation of careless responding indicators at different parts of the survey. All of the selected indicators significantly fluctuated in time and the results indicate that careless responding generally becomes more severe toward the end of the survey. Different types of indicators showed different trends at specific phases of the survey. We argue this suggests distinct qualities of careless responding are being measured by particular indicators and their sensitivity changes for different points in time. Our manipulation with participants’ feeling of accountability and fixed/randomized item order had no significant impact on the indicator scores. In the exploratory part, we provide characteristics of careless cognitive and responding strategies, as well as the subjective perception of careless responding indicator items, based on respondents’ verbal feedback.

In this paper we focus on two of the most salient concerns—that MTurk participants may not buy into interactive experiments and that they may produce unreliable or invalid data. We review existing research on these topics and present new data to address these concerns. We find that insufficient attention is no more a problem among MTurk samples than among other commonly used convenience or high-quality commercial samples, and that MTurk participants buy into interactive experiments and trust researchers as much as participants in laboratory studies. Furthermore, we find that employing rigorous exclusion methods consistently boosts statistical power without introducing problematic side effects (e.g., substantially biasing the post-exclusion sample), and can thus provide a general solution for dealing with problematic respondents across samples.

Lowmaster, Michael J. Hartman, Johannes Zimmermann, Zachary C. Baldock and John E. Kurtz (Journal of Personality Assessment, 2020[Nov-Dec], Vol 102[6], 743-750). The number of Keeley et al.'s (2016) INC scale item pairs remaining in the short-form version of the PID–5 (Maples et al., 2015) was incorrectly identified in the original article. The correct information is provided in this erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2019-63504-001[/rid]). Assessment of protocol validity is essential for structured personality tests used in clinical decision making. Measures of inconsistent responding allow researchers and clinicians to identify random or careless response patterns that compromise an accurate interpretation of test results. Keeley and colleagues (2016) developed an Inconsistency scale (INC) for the widely used Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5; Krueger, Derringer, Markon, Watson, & Skodol. 2012. Initial construction of a maladaptive personality trait model and inventory for DSM-5. Psychological Medicine, 42(9), 1879–1890.). The INC produced highly promising results in initial validation studies, and the current study provides a series of additional tests of the adaptability of the INC item pairs across different populations, translations, and versions of the PID-5. Study 1 examines the diagnostic utility of a shortened version of the original INC scale (INC-S) that can be used with the 100-item version of the PID-5; optimum cut scores are identified for this short form adaptation. Study 2 cross-validates the INC-S and compares diagnostic utility to the INC in a sample that completed the full PID-5. Study 3 examines the diagnostic utility of the INC and INC-S using a German translation of the PID-5 with undergraduates and clinical patients. Overall, these validation studies provide robust support for the INC and INC-S scales to discriminate random-generated versus real PID-5 protocols.

We assessed misrepresentation by comparing self-reports of personality and cognitive ability against other criterion indicators of these trait levels (peer reports of personality and performance on a cognitive ability measure). OCQ bias measures bore no relationship with either of these self-criterion discrepancy measures, and were also unassociated with self-deceptive enhancement scores. One OCQ index bore a modest relationship to narcissism. OCQ bias measures were instead consistently and sometimes even highly related to measures of careless responding. However, statistically controlling for careless responding only minimally improved the convergent validity of OCQ bias indices.

The TAPIR initially was constructed and cross-validated using exclusively English-speaking participants from the United States; however, research using the TriPM has been increasingly conducted internationally, with numerous foreign language translations of the measure emerging. The present study examined the cross-language utility of the TAPIR in German, Dutch, Swedish, and Italian translations of the TriPM using 6 archival samples of community members, university students, forensic psychiatric inpatients, forensic detainees, and adolescents residing outside the United States (combined N = 5,404). Findings suggest that the TAPIR effectively detects careless responding across these 4 translated versions of the TriPM without the need for language-specific modifications. The TAPIR total score meaningfully discriminated genuine participant responses from both fully and partially randomly generated data in every sample, and demonstrated further utility in detecting fixed 'all true' or 'all false' response patterns. In addition, TAPIR scores were reliably associated with inconsistent responding scores from another psychopathy inventory. Specificity for a range of tentative cut scores for assessing profile validity was modestly reduced among our samples relative to rates previously obtained with the English version of the TriPM; however, overall the TAPIR appears to demonstrate satisfactory cross-language generalizability.

The number of Keeley et al.'s (2016) INC scale item pairs remaining in the short-form version of the PID–5 (Maples et al., 2015) was incorrectly identified in the original article. The correct information is provided in the erratum.] Assessment of protocol validity is essential for structured personality tests used in clinical decision making. Measures of inconsistent responding allow researchers and clinicians to identify random or careless response patterns that compromise an accurate interpretation of test results. Keeley and colleagues (2016) developed an Inconsistency scale (INC) for the widely used Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5; Krueger, Derringer, Markon, Watson, & Skodol. 2012. Initial construction of a maladaptive personality trait model and inventory for DSM-5. Psychological Medicine, 42(9), 1879–1890.). The INC produced highly promising results in initial validation studies, and the current study provides a series of additional tests of the adaptability of the INC item pairs across different populations, translations, and versions of the PID-5. Study 1 examines the diagnostic utility of a shortened version of the original INC scale (INC-S) that can be used with the 100-item version of the PID-5; optimum cut scores are identified for this short form adaptation. Study 2 cross-validates the INC-S and compares diagnostic utility to the INC in a sample that completed the full PID-5. Study 3 examines the diagnostic utility of the INC and INC-S using a German translation of the PID-5 with undergraduates and clinical patients. Overall, these validation studies provide robust support for the INC and INC-S scales to discriminate random-generated versus real PID-5 protocols.

Keeley, J. W., Webb, Peterson, Roussin, and Flanagan (2016) proposed a measure of response inconsistency for the Personality Inventory for DSM–5 (PID-5-VRIN). In order to evaluate the ability of the PID-5-VRIN scale to detect inconsistent responding, we examined 3 independent archival samples of Italian community-dwelling adolescents (N = 1,264), community-dwelling adults (N = 2,143), and clinical adults (N = 706) who were administered the PID-5. The impact of PID-5-VRIN scores on the associations with interview-based personality disorder (PD) scores was also assessed among clinical adults. PID-5-VRIN item pairs showed correlational values of at least medium size by conventional standards. Moreover, the PID-5-VRIN seemed to be efficient in discriminating real data from random responses in all samples. In line with Keeley and colleagues’ findings, a PID-5-VRIN total score of 17 represented the best balance between sensitivity and specificity in all samples. Clinical adult participants who met this threshold for invalidity also obtained significantly higher scores on the majority of PID-5 trait scales. When the correlations between selected PID-5 trait scale scores and the corresponding interview-based ratings of DSM–5 Section II PDs were considered, appreciable differences in the magnitude and/or direction of association were observed between participants scoring below the PID-5-VRIN cutoff and those meeting the threshold for invalidity (≥17). As a whole, our data suggest that the PID-5-VRIN represents an efficient means of assessing inconsistent responding on the PID-5.

It is crucial for researchers or practitioners to remove these kinds of repeating patterns before conducting any similarity analysis. In this study, a new algorithm for finding repeating patterns is proposed. The application of this algorithm on real and simulated data showed satisfying results; the simulated repeating patterns were identified 100% by the new algorithm with a negligible false positive rate. Although illustrated only in the context of similarity analysis, the proposed algorithm has broad applications: for example, identifying unmotivated test-takers for school intervention or cleaning data before estimating item parameters under an item response theory model.

This study addresses these questions among an understudied sample of 114 males incarcerated in juvenile detention center settings, who completed three creative problem-solving tasks. Using a theme-specific scoring system for negative and malevolent ideation (e.g., inappropriate sexual content, harming, substanceuse), multivariate multiple regression in the path analytic framework showed an inconsistency of negative ideation across themes within each task, and within each theme across tasks. Further, accounting for response accuracy as a proxy for careless responding, creative potential indicators predicted moderately the occurrence of theme-specific (up to 26 % of the variance) and composite (up to 15 % of the variance) negative creativity according to the task considered. These results are discussed with regards to the apparent situation-specificity and theme-specificity of negative ideation as well as the role of careless responding in the occurrence of such ideation.

The goal of the present study was to examine the relation between student research procrastination and two important data quality issues—careless responding and measurement noninvariance. Data gathered from university students across two semesters tentatively indicated that procrastination is related to low‐quality survey data. Procrastination was slightly more problematic for certain data quality issues (measurement noninvariance) than others (careless responding). These relations, however, were small and contingent on how procrastination and careless responding were measured. Accordingly, it seems more beneficial for researchers to select a sampling window that supports their research goals and statistical power requirements rather than select a sampling window that attempts to minimize careless survey responding or other measurement issues.

However, data cleaning prior to the main analyses is not yet a standard practice. We investigated the effect of C/IE responses on the structure of personality survey data. For this purpose, we analyzed the structure of the Core-Self Evaluations scale (CSE-S), including the detection of aberrant responses in the study design. While the original theoretical model of the CSE-S assumes that the construct is unidimensional (Judge et al., 2003), recent studies have argued for a multidimensional solution (positive CSE and negative CSE). We hypothesized that this multidimensionality is not substantive but a result of the tendency of C/IE data to generate spurious dimensions. We estimated the confirmatory models before and after removing highly inconsistent response vectors in two independent samples (6% and 4.7%). The analysis of the raw samples clearly favored retaining the two-dimensional model. In contrast, the analysis of the clean datasets suggested the retention of a single factor. A mere 6% C/IE response rate showed enough power to confound the results of the factor analysis. This result suggests that the factor structure of positive and negative CSE factors is spurious, resulting from uncontrolled wording variance produced by a limited proportion of highly inconsistent response vectors. We encourage researchers to include screening for inconsistent responses in their research designs.

Latent class analysis was used to identify groups of non-careless and careless responders from the attentiveness checks. Analyses compared psychometric properties of the QoL measures (reliability of PROMIS short-forms, correlations among QoL scores, 'known-groups' validity) between non-careless and careless responder groups. Whether person-fit statistics derived from PROMIS measures accurately discriminated careless and non-careless responders was also examined.Results: About 7.4% of participants were classified as careless responders. No substantial differences in the reliability of PROMIS measures between non-careless and careless responder groups were observed. However, careless responding meaningfully and significantly affected the correlations among QoL domains, as well as the magnitude of differences in QoL between medical and disability groups (presence or absence of disability, depression diagnosis, chronic pain diagnosis).

Little attention has been directed to the implications of C/RR for juvenile forensic mental health assessment. To address this gap in the literature, we reviewed frequently used measures in juvenile forensic assessment. We found that many such measures do not include built-in checks for detecting C/RR. We then conducted simulation studies examining two frequently used measures, one without a built-in check for C/RR and one with such a scale: the Youth Self-Report (YSR) and the Millon Adolescent Clinical Inventory (MACI), respectively. Results indicated that random responding substantially influenced scores on the YSR, raising most scales well above normative levels, yet often producing protocols that seemed genuine. On the MACI, random responding was undetected 25% of the time and another 50% of the time appears to yield computer-based reports that do not explicitly reject the test results as invalid.

In three studies, we use social psychological theories to develop and test three prevention strategies (Ward & Pond III, ) related to increasing respondent motivation to respond carefully. Study 1 presented control, scripted, or video‐recorded instructions designed to increase the social influence of survey administrators on survey participants. Participants in the control group were significantly more likely to admit to CR than the script and video groups. Compared with the control, scripted instructions decreased interest, and had no effect on objective indicators of CR. Study 2 found that instructions designed to induce cognitive dissonance increased logical consistency of responses and survey interest. Instructions to create a sense of hypocrisy increased accuracy on instructed‐response items. Study 3 showed that leveraging social exchange theory in survey instructions generally had no effect on CR. Similar results were found for both continuous and dichotomous scoring of indicators of CR across the three studies. Results demonstrate that facets of CR can be influenced via survey design. Future studies are needed to develop a more thorough understanding of best practices in survey design with respect to preventing CR.

U2ZHREL5,journalArticle,2022,"Voss, Nathaniel Mark",The effects of careless survey responding on the fit of latent variable models: A simulation study,Dissertations,,,,,"Surveys are one of the most popular, useful, and efficient methods for gathering data within both academic and organizational settings. Despite the many benefits afforded by surveys, research shows that a nontrivial number of people engage in careless responding (CR) such that their responses to surveys are not effortful, accurate or valid. This is problematic because the failure to account for CR can distort research findings, result in false theoretical conclusions and lead to precarious workplace decisions. With surveys, it is common to model responses with a latent variable framework and use fit indices to makes conclusions about how well the model represents the data. Research shows that CR can be associated with poor fit, good fit, and/or unrelated to fit. To better understand how CR affects fit, the primary goal of this study was to examine the consequences of CR on the fit of latent variable models using a comprehensive, realistic and rigorous simulation paradigm. A secondary goal was to better elucidate the nature of CR and specify how CR behavior manifests within survey responses. In Study 1, participants' survey response patterns were experimentally shaped. In Study 2, these results were used as a basis for the primary simulation. A total of 144 conditions (which varied the sample size, number of items, CR prevalence, CR severity, and CR type), two latent variable models (item response theory and confirmatory factor analysis), and six model fit indices were examined. Overall, the results of this study show that CR is frequently associated with deteriorations in model fit. These effects are, however, highly nuanced, variable, and contingent on many factors. Moreover, this study demonstrates that good fit is not necessarily indicative of careful responding nor is poor fit always emblematic of CR. Rather, model fit and CR/response validity are distinct issues that must be separately addressed. These findings can be leveraged by researchers to develop more accurate theories and practitioners to better manage survey data that is laden with CR.

Second, we include a voluntary opt-in panel (without monetary incentive) well suited for conducting survey experiments (e.g., factorial surveys). Respondents’ reactions to the detection items are analyzed by objective, nonreactive indicators (i.e., break-off, item non-response, and measurement quality), and two self-report scales. Our reaction analyses reveal that the detection methods we applied are not only well suited for identifying careless respondents, but also exert a motivational rather than a demotivating influence on respondents’ answer behavior and, hence, contribute to data quality.

Consistency of responses to personal information questions and scale items were compared, and the influence of perceived social support, social appearance anxiety, academic self-efficacy and social networking habits on inconsistent responding was examined. Design/methodology/approach A gaming application on Facebook was used to collect data. A repeated-measures design was conducted with 806 respondents in two online survey administrations. After inconsistent responses provided by the same nicknames were identified, consistent and inconsistent respondents were compared with regard to their responding patterns and research variables. Findings Findings revealed that 45.7 percent of participants misreported their personal information such as age, educational status and gender. Participants were relatively consistent in their responses to attitude scales. Perceived social support led to inconsistent responding whereas social appearance anxiety and academic self-efficacy was not influential in response patterns. A binary logistic regression revealed that perceived family support, number of Facebook friends and Facebook use duration successfully distinguished inconsistent respondents from consistent respondents. Research limitations/implications The sample frame has several limitations insofar as the study only addressed a unique gaming application on Facebook. Thus, unique interactive characteristics of the current context may have altered the nature of responding. Practical implications Practitioners should not rely on the personal information provided by online survey respondents to conduct parametric tests, whereas responses to online attitude scales seemed relatively consistent. Originality/value The principal contribution of the paper is that findings have provided insights into the current status of response patterns in online survey administrations.

The tendency of Inattentive Stayers to remain in the panel is particularly relevant for online panel services such as MTurk, with workers participating in many surveys over longer time-periods. We find IMC-failure to be mitigated by a warning to respondents that their attention will be checked early in the survey, but not by repeated exposure to IMCs, or a timer leaving questions on the screen longer.

Four different styles of warning messages are examined in data from a randomized survey experiment conducted on the Internet. The analysis shows that three of the four warnings significantly improve respondent engagement. There is some evidence, however, that warning messages increase socially desirable responding (SDR) for certain types of people. We conclude that warnings can be a useful method for increasing attention, but that researchers should first establish that these protocol do not have unintended consequences, either for the entire sample or for theoretically relevant subgroups.Social scientists increasingly collect data online through self-administered questionnaires. However, these data can suffer from a variety of problems—e.g., no opinion responding, non-differentiation, acquiescence—in part because respondents may not pay attention as they answer a questionnaire (Krosnick 1991; Berinsky, Margolis, and Sances 2014). This study examines the effectiveness of warnings as a method for improving data quality in self-administered surveys. Generally speaking, warnings encourage respondents to follow instructions or to think carefully (Krosnick 2000). There is evidence that such messages can be effective (Huang et al. 2012), but warnings may increase social desirability pressures. Moreover, this effect may be concentrated among particular respondents, such as the highly educated, because of their greater overall tendency to offer socially desirable responses (Silver, Anderson, and Abramson 1986).",1/1/15,9/23/22 2:04,9/23/22 2:04,9/23/22 2:04,790-802,,3,79,,Public Opinion Quarterly,,,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/B78BLLPC/Clifford and Jerit - 2015 - Do Attempts to Improve Respondent Attention Increa.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These prima facie attention checks range from the simple such as reverse scaling first proposed a century ago to more recent and involved methods such as evaluating response patterns and timed responses via online data capture tools. The attention check validations also range from easily implemented mechanisms such as automatic detection through directed queries to highly intensive investigation of responses by the researcher. The latter has the potential to introduce inadvertent researcher bias as the researcher's judgment may impact the interpretation of the data. The empirical findings of the present work reveal that construct and scale validations show consistently significant improvement in the fit statistics—a finding of great use for researchers working predominantly with scales and constructs for their empirical models. However, based on the rudimentary experimental models employed in the analysis, attention checks generally do not show a consistent, systematic improvement in the significance of test statistics for experimental manipulations. This latter result indicates that, by their very nature, attention checks may trigger an inherent trade-off between loss of sample subjects—lowered power and increased Type II error—and the potential of capitalizing on chance alone—the possibility that the previously significant results were in fact the result of Type I error. The analysis also shows that the attrition rates due to attention checks—upwards of 70% in some observed samples—are far larger than typically assumed. Such loss rates raise the specter that studies not validating attention may inadvertently increase their Type I error rate. The manuscript provides general guidelines for various attention checks, discusses the psychological nuances of the methods, and highlights the delicate balance among incentive alignment, monetary compensation, and the subsequently triggered mood of respondents.",11/1/17,9/23/22 2:00,10/21/22 2:29,9/23/22 2:00,63-70,,,53-56,,Journal of Operations Management,Attention by design,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/C5LXX2WJ/Abbey_Meloy_2017_Attention by design.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/5LRDJGBG/Abbey and Meloy - 2017 - Attention by design Using attention checks to det.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/L7N8VSG4/S0272696317300402.html,,,Attention checks; Data validation; Manipulation checks; Response validation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These paid online sampling methods offer a convenient and inexpensive recruitment strategy. The quality of data may be questionable due to careless responding and identity misrepresentation which can bias study results. It is necessary to investigate data quality given the important implications of gambling research in guiding policy decisions, public health initiatives, and treatments. In this review article, we 1) critically analyze the advantages and limitations of paid online recruitment methods, including associated threats to data quality in the gambling literature; 2) present findings from a rapid review of gambling studies using online panel and crowdsource data; and 3) outline recommendations for maximizing data quality and trustworthiness of findings. Substantially overinflated problem gambling rates were found in the 63 gambling studies we reviewed; less than one-quarter had incorporated data quality checks and reported participation rates. Future studies should incorporate pre-registration of methodology and analysis plans, robust participant screening procedures, mid-survey attention and response consistency items, and an analysis of response quality post data collection. Applying these recommendations to nonrepresentative online panel and crowdsource-based studies may enhance the replicability of findings in additional studies using representative samples (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",3/6/21,9/23/22 13:11,10/6/22 18:53,,,,,,,International Gambling Studies,Paid online convenience samples in gambling studies,,,,,,,,,,,2021-26461-001,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Taylor & Francis,,,https://proxying.lib.ncsu.edu/index.php?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=psyh&AN=2021-26461-001&site=ehost-live&scope=site&scope=cite,,Amazon MTurk; crowdsource; data integrity; No terms assigned; online panel; Problem gambling; qualtrics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IN4FVKWI,journalArticle,2017,"Ranger, Jochen; Kuhn, Jörg-Tobias",Detecting unmotivated individuals with a new model-selection approach for Rasch models,Psychological Test and Assessment Modeling,,2190-0493,,,"In low-stakes tests some test takers do not work with high motivation but respond carelessly. This has serious consequences for item response models as careless responses impair model calibration and trait inference. In this manuscript we describe an approach to data analysis that reduces the negative implications of careless responding and allows for the identification of the poorly motivated test takers. The approach has been inspired by the Rasch model answer tree (also Rasch tree) suggested by Strobl, Kopf, and Zeileis (2015). The Rasch model answer tree subdivides the sample into several strata in a data driven way by means of significance tests and fits a distinct Rasch model to each stratum. In our new approach we build on this idea of partitioning the data into strata via a sequence of splits. Contrary to this approach we determine multi-group Rasch models by enforcing theoretically motivated configurations of hierarchical data splits and select among the configurations via information criteria. By using the response times of the test takers for partitioning, a stratum can be isolated that contains the motivated test takers and allows for unbiased model calibration. The performance of this new approach with respect to parameter recovery and the detection of unmotivated test takers are compared to alternative models for low-stakes tests in a simulation study, namely the latent class model of Meyer (2010) and a finite mixture model for the response times. The simulation study demonstrates that the new approach reduces the bias caused by low motivation under certain circumstances. An empirical application underscores the usefulness of our suggestion.

These satisficing strategies become more likely with decreasing motivation and/or cognitive ability (Krosnick, 1991). Considering that cognitive deficits are characteristic of depressive and anxiety disorders, depressed and anxious patients may be prone to satisficing. Using data from the Netherland’s Study of Depression and Anxiety (N = 2,945), we studied the relationship between depression and anxiety, cognitive symptoms, and satisficing strategies on the NEO Five-Factor Inventory. Results showed that respondents with either an anxiety disorder or a comorbid anxiety and depression disorder used satisficing strategies substantially more often than healthy respondents. Cognitive symptom severity partly mediated the effect of anxiety disorder and comorbid anxiety disorder on satisficing. The results suggest that depressed and anxious patients produce relatively low-quality self-report data—partly due to cognitive symptoms. Future research should investigate the degree of satisficing across different mental health care assessment contexts.

In this article the affiliation details for Author A were incorrectly given as EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT but should have been IPN–Leibniz Institute for Science and Mathematics Education’. Original article has been revised. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2022-12011-001[/rid]). Careless and insufficient effort responding (C/IER) can pose a major threat to data quality and, as such, to validity of inferences drawn from questionnaire data. A rich body of methods aiming at its detection has been developed. Most of these methods can detect only specific types of C/IER patterns. However, typically different types of C/IER patterns occur within one data set and need to be accounted for. We present a model-based approach for detecting manifold manifestations of C/IER at once. This is achieved by leveraging response time (RT) information available from computer-administered questionnaires and integrating theoretical considerations on C/IER with recent psychometric modeling approaches. The approach a) takes the specifics of attentive response behavior on questionnaires into account by incorporating the distance–difficulty hypothesis, b) allows for attentiveness to vary on the screen-by-respondent level, c) allows for respondents with different trait and speed levels to differ in their attentiveness, and d) at once deals with various response patterns arising from C/IER. The approach makes use of item-level RTs. An adapted version for aggregated RTs is presented that supports screening for C/IER behavior on the respondent level. Parameter recovery is investigated in a simulation study. The approach is illustrated in an empirical example, comparing different RT measures and contrasting the proposed model-based procedure against indicator-based multiple-hurdle approaches.

Person misfit may reflect low quality self‐report data, for example due to random responding or misunderstanding of items. However, recent research in the context of psychopathology suggests that person misfit may reflect atypical symptom profiles that have implications for diagnosis or treatment. We followed‐up on Wanders et al. (Journal of Affective Disorders, 180, 36–43, 2015) who investigated person misfit on the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS) in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (n = 2,981). Our goal was to investigate the extent to which misfit on the IDS reflects low‐quality self‐report patterns and the extent to which it reflects true atypical symptom profiles. Regression analysis showed that person misfit related more strongly to self‐report quality indicators than to variables quantifying theoretically‐derived atypical symptom profiles. A data‐driven atypical symptom profile explained most variance in person misfit, suggesting that person misfit on the IDS mainly reflects a sample‐ and questionnaire‐specific atypical symptom profile. We concluded that person‐fit statistics are useful for detecting IDS scores that may not be valid. Further research is necessary to support the interpretation of person misfit as reflecting a meaningful atypical symptom combination.

Response effort moderates the effect of cleanliness priming on moral judgments,Frontiers in Psychology,,1664-1078,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01276,"Whether cleanliness influences moral judgments has recently become a topic of debate in the psychological literature. After the initial report that activating the notion of physical purity can result in less severe moral judgments (Schnall et al., 2008a), a direct replication (Johnson et al., 2014a) with much larger sample sizes failed to yield similar findings. The current paper examines the possibility that only non-conscious activation of the cleanliness concept, as achieved in participants with low response effort on priming materials, can produce the expected effect. An online replication (Study 1, N = 214) provided evidence that, when participants exerted low (yet still acceptable) levels of response effort to the experimental material, cleanliness priming led to more lenient moral judgments than neutral priming. An online experiment (Study 2, N = 440; replicated in Study 2a, N = 436) manipulating participants’ effort on the priming task (low vs. high) supported the hypothesized mechanism. Specifically, respondents in the low response effort group were instructed to complete the priming task as quickly as possible without too much attention, and the cleanliness priming resulted in less extreme moral judgments than the neutral condition as expected. In contrast, respondents in the high response effort group were instructed to perform to the best of their ability on the priming task, with a non-significant difference on moral ratings between cleanliness and neutral conditions. In addition to helping resolve the controversy regarding the cleanliness hypothesis, the current paper calls into attention the role of response effort in the execution and replication of priming studies.",2014,9/23/22 15:17,10/6/22 20:56,9/23/22 15:17,,,,5,,,Does cleanliness influence moral judgments?,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers,,,,; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/Q6HWTX8U/Huang_2014_Does cleanliness influence moral judgments.pdf,https://proxying.lib.ncsu.edu/index.php?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=psyh&AN=2015-12585-001&site=ehost-live&scope=site&scope=cite,,cleanliness; Judgment; moral judgment; Morality; priming; Priming; replication; response effort; Responses; Social Cognition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the context of multi-item, unidimensional scales, it has been suggested that response variance may hold information about careless responding. This notion was tested in the current research with two studies. Data collected from respondents indicates that people responding carelessly display more variance in their responses than people responding with more effort. Given this finding, a procedure which uses measures of response variance and cluster analysis to identify careless respondents was developed. The effectiveness of the procedure with different specifications was tested with simulated data and validated with data from actual respondents. On the basis of the results, we advocate using the procedure with specifications that conservatively identify careless respondents.

We conducted an experiment investigating this potential impact in a sample (N?=?1,092) of working adults.

Indeed, even if paying one respondent to complete one questionnaire represents a very small cost, the multiplication of botnets providing invalid response sets may ultimately reduce study validity while increasing research costs. Several techniques have been proposed thus far to detect problematic human response sets, but little research has been undertaken to test the extent to which they actually detect nonhuman response sets. Thus, we proposed to conduct an empirical comparison of these indices. Assuming that most botnet programs are based on random uniform distributions of responses, we present and compare seven indices in this study to detect nonhuman response sets. A sample of 1,967 human respondents was mixed with different percentages (i.e., from 5% to 50%) of simulated random response sets. Three of the seven indices (i.e., response coherence, Mahalanobis distance, and person–total correlation) appear to be the best estimators for detecting nonhuman response sets.

The characterization is then applied to contaminating distributions representing various types of IER. The discussion will provide commentary on previous simulation-based investigations, confirming some previous hypotheses for the common types of IER, but also revealing possibilities from newly considered responding patterns.

We applied a procedure for creating an index of inconsistent responding at each wave that involved identifying pairs of items with considerable redundancy and calculating discrepancies in responses to these items. Inconsistent responding was generally low in the Middle School sample and moderate in the College sample, with individuals showing only modest stability in inconsistent responding over time.

Drawing from research on sleep and self-regulation, we examine both random (survey errors) and systematic (social desirability) effects of research participant insomnia on survey responses. With respect to random effects, we find that insomnia leads to increased survey errors, and that this effect is mediated by a lack of self-control and a lack of effort. However, insomnia also has a positive systematic effect, leading to lower levels of social desirability. This effect is also mediated by self-control depletion and a lack of effort. In supplemental analyses, we find that psychometric side effects of random and systematic error introduced by individuals high in insomnia negatively affect internal consistency estimates and measurement invariance on various organizational measures.

The objective of this study was to examine the possible effects of mischievous response patterns on school-based screening results. The present study included 1,857 high school students who completed a schoolwide screening for complete mental health. Student responses were reviewed to detect possible mischievous responses and to examine their association with other survey results. Consistent with previous research, mischievous responding was evaluated by items that are legitimate to ask of all students (e.g., How much do you weigh? and How many siblings do you have?). Responses were considered “mischievous” when a student selected multiple extreme, unusual (less than 5% incidence) response options, such as weighing more than 225 pounds and having 10 or more siblings. Only 1.8% of the students responded in extreme ways to 2 or more of 7 mischievous response items. When compared with other students, the mischievous responders were less likely to declare that they answered items honestly, were more likely to finish the survey in less than 10 min, reported lower levels of life satisfaction and school connectedness, and reported higher levels of emotional and behavioral distress. When applying a dual-factor mental health screening framework to the responses, mischievous responders were less likely to be categorized as having complete mental health. Implications for school-based mental health screening are discussed.

One way to prevent IER from occurring is by engaging in preventative measures to reduce different types of IER. One possible preventative measure that can be done to prevent IER is reducing the length of long surveys. To support this notion, this study looked at the effects of survey length and data quality. Results indicated that long surveys can negatively impact data quality. Specifically, factor structures of measures placed at the end of a long survey may be negatively impacted. Additionally, the reliability of measures decreased when placed later in a long survey.

While many researchers studying schizotypy have employed infrequency measures to exclude participants, such measures are not universally employed. Moreover, some researchers have even outright questioned whether validity scales are warranted. Here, we show the effect of invalid responses on the relationship between schizotypy and hedonic reaction. For valid responders, negative schizotypal traits were inversely related to both anticipatory and consummatory pleasure (p < .01). Invalid responses were found for 23% of respondents, and within these subjects, no relationship was found between any of the measures. When the valid and invalid respondents were pooled, the relationship was dampened. Furthermore, linear multiple regression modeling showed that validity trended toward moderating the relationship between the variables of interest. These data highlight the importance of screening for, and excluding, invalid responses in schizotypy research. Our results also affirm that screening for random responding is effective and warranted. Implications for future studies employing questionnaire-based methods are discussed.

Thus, analyzing only those data that are an honest representation of a sample is imperative for drawing accurate conclusions that allow for robust, generalizable, and replicable scientific findings. Unfortunately, a consistent line of evidence indicates the presence of inattentive/careless responders who provide low-quality data in surveys, especially on popular online crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Yet, the majority of psychological studies using surveys only conduct outlier detection analyses to remove problematic data. Without carefully examining the possibility of low-quality data in a sample, researchers risk promoting inaccurate conclusions that interfere with scientific progress. Given that knowledge about data screening methods and optimal online data collection procedures are scattered across disparate disciplines, the dearth of psychological studies using more rigorous methodologies to prevent and detect low-quality data is likely due to inconvenience, not maleficence. Thus, this review provides up-to-date recommendations for best practices in collecting online data and data screening methods.

These are all explicit steps in the test construction process as it is described by textbooks and research articles (Clark & Watson, 1995; Simms, 2008; Ziegler, 2014). One aspect that appears to receive less attention is the choice of response format. When the questionnaire is a self-report (or other-report) measure of one or more psychological constructs, test constructors appear to automatically implement a rating scale such as strongly disagree to strongly agree as the response format. The reason for this is that rating scales have served us well in the past and continue to do so. However, in this editorial we will argue that choosing the response format should be an explicit step in the test construction process that deserves special attention and considerable thought. In fact, the response format should be chosen to fit the construct best. We will also argue that we need a greater diversity of response formats and more research on them.

Design/methodology/approach A total of 13,340 SET surveys collected by a major Jordanian university to assess teaching effectiveness were analyzed in this study. The detection method was used to detect IER, and the construct (factorial) validity was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and principal component analysis (PCA) before and after removing detected IER. Findings The results of this study show that 2,160 SET surveys were flagged as insufficient effort responses out of 13,340 surveys. This figure represents 16.2 percent of the sample. Moreover, the results of CFA and PCA show that removing detected IER statistically enhanced the construct (factorial) validity of the SET survey. Research limitations/implications Since IER responses are often ignored by researchers and practitioners in industrial and organizational psychology (Liu et al., 2013), the results of this study strongly suggest that higher education administrations should give the necessary attention to IER responses, as SET results are used in making critical decisions Practical implications The results of the current study recommend universities to carefully design online SET surveys, and provide the students with clear instructions in order to minimize students’ engagement in IER. Moreover, since SET results are used in making critical decisions, higher education administrations should give the necessary attention to IER by examining the IERs rate in their data sets and its consequences on the data quality. Originality/value Reviewing the related literature shows that this is the first study that investigates the effect of IER on construct validity of SET in higher education using an IRT-based detection method.",1/1/19,9/23/22 15:50,10/6/22 19:08,9/23/22 15:50,604-615,,3,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Emerald Insight,,Publisher: Emerald Publishing Limited,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/NASGKQP3/AlQuraan_2019_The effect of insufficient effort responding on the validity of student.pdf,,,Construct validity; Insufficient effort responding (IER); Student evaluation of teaching (SET),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several statistical indices exist in order to detect problematic data. In line with a previous study that compared these indices in Likert-type scale questionnaire data, this study purported to extend the analyses with dichotomous-itemed questionnaires. Three samples of about more than 2,000 participants were mixed with different proportions (i.e., 5% to 50%) of simulated data to mimic their effect. Then, seven indices were compared in terms of correct detections of non-human response sets. Consistent with former findings, three indices resulted in superior correct detection rates: response coherence, the Mahalanobis distance and the person-total correlation.

The model is estimated using a fully Bayesian estimation procedure. By applying this model to a real test data set measuring extraversion, we explore a theory that both response styles and anchoring might be viewed as evidence of a lack of effortful responding. Empirical results show that there is a positive correlation between the strength of midpoint response style and the anchoring effect; further, responses indicative of either anchoring or response style both negatively correlate with response time, consistent with a theory that both phenomena reflect reduced respondent effort.

The present paper reports two studies that address this overall question. Study 1 (N = 243) demonstrated that (a) IER was negatively related to performance on objective tests, and (b) IER was related to survey measures depending on the means of these measures. As a result, IER could inflate an objective test’s associations with other object tests and survey measures. Using simulations, Study 2 examined the impact of two IER parameters – within-person consistency of IER and proportion of IER in the sample. When predicting the confounding effects of IER, within-person consistency had positive linear and quadratic effects, proportion of IER cases had a positive linear effect, and consistency and proportion had a positive interactive effect.

But, only recently have researchers studied the detection and impact of answer patterns that respondents provide when not enacting critical steps in the expected response process. I term these answer patterns Low Cognitive Effort (LCE) response vectors where the term response vector refers to a complete set of item responses provided by a single respondent. Previous research suggests that the most promising LCE detection methods flag up 10 to 20% of respondents and that statistics like Cronbach’s alpha may shift between 5 and 15% when LCE vectors are present in samples. This study examines both the detection and impact of LCE vectors using simulated and empirical data. Three person fit statistics from Item Response Theory modeling that have not previously been examined as LCE detection methods are compared with eight previously examined detection methods. Further, this study examines how simulated LCE vectors affect common survey properties and statistics when plausible amounts of these responses are present in samples. In general, this study finds that the impact of LCE vectors is minimal under the most plausible circumstances. Further, the results corroborate previous findings that researchers should be most concerned with any amount of invariant, “straight line” response vectors because these appear to have the largest impacts on conclusions. When seeking to remove LCE vectors, this study finds that a combination of a subset of the studied methods perform very well at flagging potential LCE responses.",,9/23/22 15:52,10/22/22 19:14,9/23/22 15:52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9780438773547,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/HSXY53BH/Turner_Link to external site_The Detection and Impact of Low Cognitive Effort Survey Responses.pdf,,,Cognition; Detection; Education; Effort; Insufficient; Psychology; Pure sciences; Response; Survey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the shortened measure precludes use of the Inconsistent Responding (IR) scales embedded in the full PPI-R.

Across both samples our newly constructed scale, the Inconsistent Responding-Short-10 (IRS-10), correlated moderately with existing IR scales of the PPI-R (rs=.35–.48) and was associated with several external indicators of inattentiveness, including trait conscientiousness among undergraduates and symptoms of psychosis among forensic inpatients. ROC curve analyses demonstrated that IRS-10 scores strongly discriminated between respondent and randomly-generated protocols and tentative cut scores for profile invalidity are proposed based on rates of sensitivity and specificity.

When participants respond without sufficient effort their responses are considered to be careless, and these responses represent error. Many methods exist for the detection of these individuals (Huang, Curran, Keeney, Poposki, & Deshon, 2012; Johnson, 2005; Meade & Craig, 2012), and several techniques exist for testing their effectiveness. These techniques often involve generating careless responses through some process, then attempting to detect those known cases in otherwise normal data. One method to produce these data is through the simulation of data with varying degrees of randomness. Despite the common use of this technique, we know little about how it actually maps onto real world data. The purpose of this paper is to compare simulated data with real world data on commonly used careless response metrics. Results suggest that care should be applied when simulating data, and that decisions researchers make when generating this data can have large effects on the apparent effectiveness of these metrics. Despite these potential limitations, it appears that with proper use and continued research simulation techniques can still be quite valuable.",10/14/19,9/23/22 15:53,10/22/22 18:59,9/23/22 15:53,,,,,,,Creating Carelessness,,,,,,,en-us,,,,,OSF Preprints,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/PPR9XGT4/Curran_Denison_2019_Creating Carelessness.pdf,,looks interesting,careless responding; Computational Modeling; data simulation; insufficient effort responding; invalid response; Quantitative Methods; Social and Behavioral Sciences; Theory and Philosophy of Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence suggests that gender binary and gender minority participants perceive gender identity measures differently, with gender binary participants potentially perceiving more gender inclusive measures as laborious and gender minority participants perceiving less gender inclusive measures as misgendering or invalidating. We sought to test whether seven versions of an online questionnaire (six experimental conditions with gender identity questions listed at the beginning of the questionnaire varying in gender inclusivity, and one control condition) significantly impacted participant affect, perceptions of survey value and survey enjoyment, attitudes toward the researcher, and careless or insufficient effort responding. Despite our efforts to recruit a gender-diverse sample, we recruited predominantly gender binary (n = 384; gender minority, n = 6) university members (students and nonstudents) at a large Midwestern university and Amazon Mechanical Turk workers. Contrary to predictions, there were very few differences between conditions. However, we did find that nonheterosexual (heterosexual) gender binary participants found the survey more (less) enjoyable after completing both versions of the two-step approach, relative to participants in the control condition; more conservative gender binary participants recruited from the university found the survey less valuable after completing the two-step approach (that requested sex then gender identity) relative to participants in the control condition; categorizability of gender identity responses did not differ across conditions, but codability and accuracy did; and last, correlations between neuroticism and organizational citizenship behavior were the only relationships that significantly differed across conditions. All things considered, researchers have some flexibility regarding which gender identity question format they decide to use within a predominantly gender binary sample. This flexibility decreases if researchers are concerned with how much enjoyment participants will get out of the survey or if gender identity collection either depends on codability or accuracy of responses.",,9/23/22 15:53,10/22/22 19:53,9/23/22 15:53,,,,,,,"Often Overlooked, but Not Forgotten",,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798662381933,,"/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/AMBX5DE4/Pawirosetiko_Often Overlooked, but Not Forgotten.pdf",,,Demographics; Gender; Gender identity; Survey design,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Insufficient effort responding (IER) to surveys occurs when participants fail to carefully read survey instructions or item content. Researchers commonly analyze IER as a methodological nuisance. The purpose of this article is to examine the extent to which negative emotions and thoughts predict proactive and reactive IER indicators. A sample of 625 participants completed an online survey containing a background questionnaire, the agreeableness and conscientiousness subscales of the Mini-International Personality Item Pool, the intrinsic motivation subscale of the Situational Motivational Scale, the Boredom Proneness Scale, and three proactive and six reactive IER indices. Binary logistic regression analysis results showed participants who experienced higher levels of state anxiety, distress, and sadness while completing the survey were more likely to not pay attention and/or violate test instructions. Participants who indicated they regretted agreeing to participate in the survey, were more likely to not pay attention, respond dishonestly, respond too quickly, and/or self-report that they had exerted little effort and attention. These findings suggest that IER behaviors are, in part, a manifestation of participants’ negative emotions and thoughts.

For many large-scale assessments, students answer questionnaire and test items in succession. This study examines the percentage of students who continuously engage in disengaged responding behaviors across sections in a low-stakes assessment. The effects on calculated scores of filtering students, based on their responding behaviors, are also analyzed. Data of this study came from the 2015 administration of PISA. For data analysis, frequencies and percentages of engaged students in the sessions were initially calculated using students' response times. To investigate the impact of filtering disengaged respondents on parameter estimation, three groups were created, namely engaged in both measures, engaged only in the test, and engaged only in the questionnaire. Next, several validity checks were performed on each group to verify the accuracy of the classifications and the impact of filtering student groups based on their responding behavior. The results indicate that students who are disengaged in tests tend to continue this behavior when responding to the questionnaire items in PISA. Moreover, the rate of continuity of disengaged responding is non-negligible as can be seen from the effect sizes. On the other hand, removing disengaged students in both measures led to higher or nearly the same performance ratings compared to the other groups. Researchers analyzing the dataset including achievement tests and survey items are recommended to review disengaged responses and filter out students who are continuously showing disengaged responding before performing further statistical analysis.",9/5/21,9/23/22 15:53,9/23/22 15:53,9/23/22 15:53,527-541,,3,8,,,The Continuity of Students’ Disengaged Responding in Low-stakes Assessments,,,,,,,en,,,,,dergipark.org.tr,,Number: 3,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/HJR7AF6W/Bulut_2021_The Continuity of Students’ Disengaged Responding in Low-stakes Assessments.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/MCICSXU7/789212.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research on IER reveals that it is not only prevalent among undergraduate research participants, but that normal data cleaning procedures do not capture participants who engage in IER. Identifying these participants is important however, as a high prevalence of IER has the potential to change the substantive conclusions drawn from the data. Individual differences in personality has been shown to be related to IER. However, systematically removing participants based on individual differences can reduce the representativeness of samples used in psychological research. Therefore, it is necessary for researchers to identify variables that correlate with IER, with the hopes that these variables can be manipulated through intervention strategies to reduce IER among volunteer participants. Extending previous research, this dissertation aimed to explore IER from a motivational perspective using self-determination theory (SDT) across four studies. According to SDT, motivation can be lacking altogether (amotivation), or differ in quality based on the degree to which behaviors are reflective of the self (controlled versus autonomous motivation). Using proactive (instructed-response, bogus items) and reactive (longstring index, response time) measures, Study 1 examined the prevalence of IER within an online survey administered to undergraduate participants. In addition, time of semester, gender, and global motivation were explored as potential correlates of IER. Extending the findings of Study 1, Study 2 included an assessment of Academic motivation, and Study 3 and Study 4 also included an assessment of motivation toward research participation. Furthermore, Study 3 compared the rates of IER among participants based on location (laboratory vs online) x warning message (warning vs no warning). Finally, in Study 4, the effectiveness of using an autonomy supportive intervention strategy to reduce IER was examined, by introducing the study using non-pressuring language, providing rationale, perspective-taking, and acknowledging participants’ negative feelings. Results of these studies indicated that a) IER occurs at problematic rates within the University of Ottawa sample b) IER is positively correlated with student’s lack of motivation at the academic and research-specific levels, c) testing participants within a laboratory setting versus online may not be sufficient to deter IER, nor does providing a warning message, and d) framing research in a manner that supports participants’ sense of autonomy may suppress the positive relationship between amotivation towards research and IER. Overall, the results of these studies support the on-going need to identify IER, and to study IER within a motivational framework in order to improve the reliability and validity of findings drawn from psychological survey research.",12/20/19,9/23/22 15:53,10/22/22 20:23,9/23/22 15:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ruor.uottawa.ca,,Accepted: 2019-12-20T15:34:40Z DOI: 10.20381/ruor-24226,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/IMSW8NS8/Cheung_2019_Understanding Insufficient Effort Responding from a Self-Determination Theory.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/AGSSY8T3/39987.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We construct the inconsistent index and connect it to the individual’s exposure to air pollution. The preferred estimate reveals that a one standard deviation of PM2.5 (around 30 μg/m3) increases the likelihood of inconsistency by 2.25%. Further heterogeneous analysis shows that air pollution appears to have larger effects on those young groups with high education but low income, especially for students, and the number is 5.36%.

Although this concept was introduced decades ago, few studies have focused on the quantitative detection of such a burden. In this paper, a face-to-face survey and a telephone survey conducted in Valencia (Spain) are analyzed. The presence of burden is studied in terms of both item non-response rates and careless response rates. In particular, two moving-window statistics based on the coefficient of unalikeability and the average longstring index are proposed for characterizing careless responding. Item non-response and careless response rates are modeled for each survey by using mixed-effects models, including respondent-level and question-level covariates and also temporal random effects to assess the existence of respondent burden during the questionnaire. The results suggest that the sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents and the typology of the question impact item non-response and careless response rates. Moreover, the estimates of the temporal random effects indicate that item non-response and careless response rates are time-varying, suggesting the presence of respondent burden. In particular, an increasing trend in item non-response rates in the telephone survey has been found, which supports the hypothesis of the burden. Regarding careless responding, despite the presence of some temporal variation, no clear trend has been identified.",2021-01,9/23/22 15:53,10/5/22 22:46,9/23/22 15:53,2035,,17,9,,,Respondent Burden Effects on Item Non-Response and Careless Response Rates,,,,,,,en,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,,,,www.mdpi.com,,Number: 17 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/9GINSJT7/Briz-Redón_2021_Respondent Burden Effects on Item Non-Response and Careless Response Rates.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/MRNKT2KP/2035.html,,,coefficient of unalikeability; longstring index; question typology; sociodemographic characteristics; survey data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the most common tools used is the survey reminder, which is effective in improving response rates. However, little research has considered whether the responses gained after reminders have been distributed are of comparable quality to those obtained after initial survey invites were sent. Drawing on suboptimal response and nonresponse theories, I examine whether reminders lead survey participants to respond suboptimally, including through insufficient effort response and socially desirable response, as well as if reminders lead to lower survey data quality. Using survey responses from 5,900 respondents to an organizational safety survey, results from measurement and structural invariance tests and concurrent t-test analyses show that reminders are not significantly associated with response distortion or measurement variance, indicating that survey reminders do not contribute to lower survey data quality.",,9/23/22 15:53,10/22/22 20:12,9/23/22 15:53,,,,,,,"Reminders May Increase Response Rates, But Is There a Cost?",,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798678132253,,"; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/CWXG5LKA/Ingels_Reminders May Increase Response Rates, But Is There a Cost.pdf",https://proxying.lib.ncsu.edu/index.php?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=psyh&AN=2021-08069-264&site=ehost-live&scope=site&scope=cite,,Insufficient effort responding; Measurement; Measurement invariance; Response Frequency; Safety; Social Desirability; Socially desirable responding; Survey reminders; Surveys; T Test; Theories,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SpRPs result when participants only superficially process the information of (online) experiments/questionnaires and attempt only to respond in a plausible way. This is due to the fact that participants who are paid are generally motivated by fast cash, and try to efficiently overcome objective plausibility checks and process other items only superficially, if at all. Thus, those participants produce not only useless but detrimental data, because they attempt to conceal their malpractice. The potential consequences are biased estimation and misleading statistical inference. The statistical nature of specific invalid response strategies and applications are discussed, effectually deriving a meta-theory of response strategy, process, and plausibility. A new test measure to detect SpRPs was developed to accommodate data of survey type, without the need of a priori implemented mechanisms. Under a latent class latent variable framework, the effectiveness of the test measure was empirically and theoretically evaluated. The empirical evaluation is based on an experimental and online questionnaire study. These studies operate under a very well established psychological framework on five stable personality traits. The measure was theoretically evaluated through simulations. It was concluded that the measure is successfully discriminating between valid responders and invalid responders under certain conditions.

Although participant carelessness cannot be disputed to exist, the impact it has on data quality or the level of influence or bias it produces in results is questionable. The main purpose of this paper is to determine whether participant carelessness is a substantial problem that significantly influences or biases the results of statistical analyses. This is accomplished by analyzing established management relationships through a comparison of the full, careful, and careless samples to determine the impact participant carelessness has on data results regarding correlations, t‑tests, and simple linear regressions. Four detection approaches were used to identify careless participants individually, in pairs, and in three method combinations. The second purpose of this paper is to use the resampled individual reliability (RIR) approach to detect careless participants and compare it to the individual reliability approach to determine whether the two approaches are fundamentally similar. Data were collected using Mechanical Turk (N = 678). Based on the findings, participant carelessness does not appear to be a substantial problem or demonstrate levels of bias in the results in this study. There are two significant differences between the full and careful samples with the t‑tests and the regression comparisons of fit statistics demonstrate the careful samples to have a weak improvement over the full sample; however, none indicate bias.

Despite its huge importance, objective measurement tools for it are scarce due to its developmental difficulty. Self-assessment of digital competence seems a promising proxy of objective tests, and it additionally offers the possibility for surveying otherwise unmeasurable constructs such as attitudes and beliefs. However, self-assessment tools are burdened with validity problems, most notably response biases such as overly positive descriptions, overclaiming or careless and insufficient effort responding. In this paper, we investigate how these problems can be mitigated by using the overclaiming technique, a technique that identifies and corrects the bias variance in self-assessments. Our main result was that the use of the overclaiming technique can lead to higher reliability and validity of digital competence self-assessment tools, especially for short scales. Moreover, it allows for correcting additional spurious variance in comparison with careless responding indexes, which allows the use of both these techniques in parallel to increase the quality of data. Our results are important in providing advances in enhanced information on digital competence that can result in better lifelong learning decisions when used at the individual level and in better policy-making decisions when used at the aggregate level.",8/31/22,9/23/22 15:54,10/6/22 19:10,9/23/22 15:54,8.94439E+15,,,,,,Can Overclaiming Technique Improve Self-Assessment Tools for Digital Competence?,,,,,,,en,,,,,SAGE Journals,,Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/EYQHNX5Q/Muszyński et al_2022_Can Overclaiming Technique Improve Self-Assessment Tools for Digital Competence.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Examples include general tendencies to agree to items (i.e., acquiescence), to disagree to items (i.e., nay-saying), and to provide extreme responses (see Cohen & Swerdlik, 2005; Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003; Swain, Weathers, & Niedrich, 2008; van Sonderen, Sanderman, & Coyne, 2013).",2014,9/23/22 15:54,10/5/22 22:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,Routledge,,,,,,,,,Num Pages: 21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using moderated non-linear factor analysis, the present study explored whether randomization, construct strength, and differences in conscientiousness and neuroticism affected respondents’ survey responding behavior to randomized and grouped versions of a communication anxiety measure. Randomization did not affect how respondents interpreted the measure’s content but did affect how they responded to matrix items that appeared next to repeated response scales. Construct strength positively predicted factor level differences, with respondents who reported feeling more certain in their answers and finding them more accessible reporting higher levels of communication anxiety and responding with greater variability. Lastly, respondents higher in conscientiousness and neuroticism were more susceptible to randomization than their counterparts, evidenced by more factor- and item-level differences. Taken together, these findings suggest researchers can randomize items without fear of affecting how respondents interpret the measure’s content. Nevertheless, randomization and grouping artificially inflated and attenuated respondent scores, respectively, calling into question the reliability of diagnoses for respondents who fall near clinically significant thresholds. Thus, I encourage researchers and practitioners to consider administering question formats besides matrices, especially those interested in using absolute scores.

One recently introduced index based on Mahalanobis’s D for detecting outliers in cross-sectional designs replaces centered scores with difference scores between repeated-measure items: Termed person temporal consistency (D2ptc). Although the adapted D2ptc index demonstrated usefulness in simulation datasets, it has not been applied to empirical data. The current study addresses D2ptc’s low uptake by critically appraising its performance across three empirical applications. Independent samples were selected to represent a range of scenarios commonly encountered by organizational researchers. First, in Sample 1, a repeat-measure of future time perspective (FTP) inexperienced working adults (age >40-years; n = 620) indicated that temporal inconsistency was significantly related to respondent age and item reverse-scoring. Second, in repeat-measure of team efficacy aggregations, D2ptc successfully detected team-level inconsistency across repeat-performance cycles. Thirdly, the usefulness of the D2ptc was examined in an experimental study dataset of subjective life expectancy indicated significantly more stable responding in experimental conditions compared to controls. The empirical findings support D2ptc’s flexible and useful application to distinct study designs. Discussion centers on current limitations and further extensions that may be of value to psychologists screening self-report data for strengthening response quality and meaningfulness of inferences from repeated-measures self-reports.

Almost no research in the published addictions literature has reported screening for random responses. We illustrate how random responses can bias statistical estimates using simulated and real data, and how this is especially problematic in skewed data, as is common with substance use outcomes. Method We first tested the effects of varying amounts and types of random responses on covariance-based statistical estimates in distributions with varying amounts of skew. We replicated these findings in correlations from a real dataset (Add Health) by replacing varying amounts of real data with simulated random responses. Results Skew and the proportion of random responses influenced the amount and direction of bias. When the data were not skewed, uniformly random responses deflated estimates, while long-string random responses inflated estimates. As the distributions became more skewed, all types of random responses began to inflate estimates, even at very small proportions. We observed similar effects in the Add Health data. Conclusions Failing to screen for random responses in survey data produces biased statistical estimates, and data with only 2.5% random responses can inflate covariance-based estimates (i.e., correlations, Cronbach’s alpha, regression coefficients, factor loadings, etc.) when data are heavily skewed. Screening for random responses can substantially improve data quality, reliability and validity.",2/1/18,9/23/22 15:54,10/6/22 18:54,9/23/22 15:54,102-110,,,183,,Drug and Alcohol Dependence,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/YFXU65BU/King et al. - 2018 - Random responses inflate statistical estimates in .pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/4GVBGP9L/King et al. - 2017 - Random responses inflate statistical estimates in .pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/RJYBFBXX/King et al_2017_Random responses inflate statistical estimates in heavily skewed addictions data.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/68XTNIET/King et al_2018_Random responses inflate statistical estimates in heavily skewed addictions data.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/4WM855V6/King et al_2018_Random responses inflate statistical estimates in heavily skewed addictions data.pdf; ; ; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/MT3MGMGE/S0376871617305811.html; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/GIVDDIRT/S0376871617305811.html,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321703627_Random_responses_inflate_statistical_estimates_in_heavily_skewed_addictions_data; https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kevin-King-10/publication/321703627_Random_responses_inflate_statistical_estimates_in_heavily_skewed_addictions_data/links/5a2d6becaca2728e05e2e0fe/Random-responses-inflate-statistical-estimates-in-heavily-skewed-addictions-data.pdf,,Invalid responses; Online surveys; Skewed data; Statistical bias,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although a large amount of MTurkers are from the United States or other predominantly English-speaking nations. However, in English language tasks, they nevertheless give poorer-quality responses than American MTurkers. Experienced MTurkers may learn that deception is common in social science research and presume that researchers are likely to be deceptive, which may change the way they respond. A variation of this concern is that repeated participation in a specific paradigm can lead participants to acquire knowledge or experience that may change how they respond.

With the growing popularity of web surveys, the importance of paradata has further increased. Within this context, response time measurement is the prevailing paradata approach. Papers typically analyse the time (measured in milliseconds or seconds) a respondent needs to answer a certain item, question, page or questionnaire. One of the key challenges when analysing the response time is to identify and separate units that are answering too quickly or too slowly. These units can have a poor response quality and are typically labelled as response time outliers. This paper focuses on approaches for identifying and processing response time outliers. It presents a systematic overview of scientific papers on response time outliers in web surveys. The key observed characteristics of the papers are the approaches used, the level of time measurement, the processing of response time outliers and the relationship between response time and response quality.

The associations between the YPI-S and theoretically relevant correlates were reduced among participants exceeding proposed cutoff scores for profile validity compared with associations among more consistent respondents.",4/1/19,9/23/22 15:55,10/6/22 19:01,9/23/22 15:55,465-478,,3,26,,Assessment,,,,,,,,en,,,,,SAGE Journals,,Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/9FK5N4NL/Kelley et al. - 2017 - Detecting Inconsistent Responding on the Youth Psy.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/9UJ87DRB/Kelley et al_2019_Detecting Inconsistent Responding on the Youth Psychopathic Traits.pdf; ,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hedwig-Eisenbarth/publication/320297105_Detecting_Inconsistent_Responding_on_the_Youth_Psychopathic_Traits_Inventory-Short_Form/links/59f98ae6a6fdcc075ec9b8ba/Detecting-Inconsistent-Responding-on-the-Youth-Psychopathic-Traits-Inventory-Short-Form.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oftentimes conclusions regarding the personality–ability relationship have as much to do with measurement methods as with the construct similarities and differences. In this article, we review key issues that touch on the relationship between cognitive ability and personality. These include the construct-method distinction, sources of test score variance, the maximal vs. typical performance distinction, and the special role for motivation in low-stakes testing. We review a general response model for cognitive and personality tests that recognizes those sources of test score variance. We then review the approaches for measuring personality through performance (objective personality tests, grit game, coding speed, economic preferences, and confidence), test and survey behavior (survey effort, response time, and item position effects), and real-world behavior (study time, registration latency, behavior residue, and social media). We also discuss ability effects on personality tests, indicated by age and cognitive ability effects, anchoring vignette rating errors, and instructions to ‘fake good’.

However, research has yet to consider the situational and individual factors that shape the extent to which employees view CWB in such a manner. In order to provide insight into the decision-making process surrounding the use of CWB as a coping strategy, this study leverages coping theory to examine the factors (both situational/within-person and individual/between-person) that contribute to employees’ beliefs that CWBs will be instrumental for emotion regulation aims in response to workplace stressors.

Sample size, test difficulty, group impact, and differential RG rates were manipulated. Findings revealed that the LR procedure was completely robust to type I errors, while slightly elevated false positive rates (< 1%) were observed for the MH and STD procedures. An applied analysis examining data from the Programme for International Student Assessment showed minimal differences in DIF classifications when comparing data in which RG responses were unfiltered and filtered.

These demonstrate three forms of miscomprehension: instructional (where instructions are not followed), sentential (where the syntax of a sentence is enriched or depleted as it is interpreted), and lexical (where different meanings of words are deployed).

These platforms have many advantages, for example it provides ease of access to difficult to sample populations, a large pool of participants, and an easy to use implementation. A major drawback is the existence of bots that are used to complete online surveys for financial gain. These bots contaminate data and need to be identified in order to draw valid conclusions from data obtained with these platforms. In this article, we will provide a Bayesian latent class joint modeling approach that can be routinely applied to identify bots and simultaneously estimate a model of interest. This method can be used to separate the bots' response patterns from real human responses that were provided in line with the item content. The model has the advantage that it is very flexible and is based on plausible assumptions that are met in most empirical settings. We will provide a simulation study that investigates the performance of the model under several relevant scenarios including sample size, proportion of bots, and model complexity. We will show that ignoring bots will lead to severe parameter bias whereas the Bayesian latent class model results in unbiased estimates and thus controls this source of bias. We will illustrate the model and its capabilities with data from an empirical political ideation survey with known bots.

Method: Participants were 827 undergraduate students (intervention, n = 518; control, n = 309). In a quasi-experimental design, students completed online surveys at 3 time points (baseline, 1-week postintervention and 4-month follow-up). Outcome measures included efficacy, readiness to change, intentions, perceived barriers to intervention, and behavior related to bystander interventions to sexual assault. Results: The intervention was effective in increasing students’ bystander efficacy, improving readiness to intervene by decreasing beliefs consistent with precontemplation and increasing those related to action, increasing intention to intervene, decreasing perceived skills deficits and concern about what others would think, and increasing proactive bystander behavior. The effects of the intervention were present for men and women and were observed in friendship and stranger contexts. All effects were maintained to 4-months without a booster. Conclusions: Integrating the preparation of peer educators and bystander-type sexual assault prevention workshops into the undergraduate curriculum can produce positive changes in male and female students’ confidence, readiness, and capacity to act as prosocial bystanders for friends and strangers, and increase some bystander behaviors.

First, responding to calls for improved measurement of outcome expectations in the domain of career exploration and decision-making (Fouad & Guillen, 2006), a measure of outcome expectations was developed that incorporates Bandura’s (1997) conceptualization of both positive and negative outcomes, as well as classes of physical, social, and self-evaluative effects. Second, the replicability of the scale’s factor structure and evidence of its validity were examined. Social cognitive career theory (SCCT; Lent & Brown, 2013) was used to explore the theoretical relationships between positive and negative outcome expectations, and other domain-specific variables, including (a) self-efficacy, (b) learning experiences, (c) social support, and (d) career exploration goals. In addition to exploring direct relationships proposed by the SCCT career self-management model, negative outcome expectations were also explored for their theorized moderation of the relations of self-efficacy to goals and positive outcome expectations to goals. Data were collected via an online survey in two separate samples of college students who were in the process of making initial career decisions. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of the new outcome expectations measure indicated a 22-item, four-factor scale with distinct positive and negative factors. Subsequent measure and hypothesis testing analyses offered support for the convergent and discriminant validity of the scale in the samples, found that exploratory intentions was linked with both self-efficacy and positive outcome expectations, and indicated a potential moderator role for negative outcome expectations in these relationships.",,9/23/22 16:29,10/22/22 20:18,9/23/22 16:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798678171542,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/ZDXB7TQK/Ireland_Link to external site_The Role of Negative Outcome Expectations in Career Exploration and.pdf,,,Career; College; Decision; Expectations; Outcome; Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Effects of Task-Centrality, Annoyance, and Arrogance on Manager Effort Allocation During Feedback-Seeking Episodes",Master's Theses,,,,https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/18538,"Employees seek feedback from managers to reduce work-related ambiguity. However, managers typically have other competing demands on their time, and as such, may not allocate sufficient effort to providing feedback. To this end, the purpose of the current study is to investigate the feedback-seeking process from the manager’s perspective. Specifically, we draw on self-regulatory theories to explain how managers balance providing feedback with other work demands. We predicted that the perception of providing feedback as a central task in one’s role as a manager would be positively related to effort allocated to delivering feedback. Furthermore, we expected annoyance to mediate this relationship. However, we did not expect the effect of task centrality on annoyance to be uniform across all managers. Instead, we predicted the relationship between task centrality and annoyance would be strongest for managers who are highly arrogant, relative to their less arrogant counterparts. We tested our predictions using a multi-wave, correlational study. Managers (N=187) reflected on a recent feedback episode, and completed self-report measures of annoyance, arrogance, task centrality, and effort. As predicted, there was a significant positive relationship between task centrality and effort. Additionally, annoyance mediated task centrality and effort. Although the focal analyses did not support arrogance as a moderator for task centrality and annoyance, supplemental analyses revealed that arrogance was associated with less effort allocated to delivering feedback, and that this effect was mediated by task centrality perceptions. The theoretical and practical implications of our findings as well as future research directions will be discussed.",8/12/22,9/23/22 16:29,10/22/22 17:55,9/23/22 16:29,,,,,,,Worth the Effort?,,,,,,,en,,,,,uwspace.uwaterloo.ca,,Accepted: 2022-08-12T12:50:37Z Publisher: University of Waterloo,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/JGWPHR2I/18538.html; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/EITHTGLW/Westlake_2022_Worth the Effort.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment variables in survey experiments involve exposing one or more groups to new information, misinformation, or vignettes. We identify a problem of treatment recall bias that affects the magnitude and significance of a treatment’s observed effect. Respondents need to recall the salient features of the treatment in order for it to have an effect. When salient treatment details are not recalled, respondents are likely to answer survey questions in a way that is statistically indistinguishable from the control group. The treatment might still have an effect on the outcome in question, but the results could be masked by respondents who do not retain salient features of the treatment. Using new survey data, we highlight how the nature of the treatment itself – text over images – significantly affects the retention of treatment details. We also show how temporal factors such as survey duration, time on treatment, engagement with treatment, and a treatment to survey duration ratio affect treatment retention. Our findings suggest that the best results from survey experiments should employ text-based treatments and calibrate time on treatment and duration based upon the best practices presented below.",3/20/18,9/23/22 16:29,10/22/22 19:03,9/23/22 16:29,,,,,,,"A Picture Is Not Worth 1,000 Words",,,,,,,en,,,,,Social Science Research Network,,,,"/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/UHITW4PW/Jardine_Kelly_2018_A Picture Is Not Worth 1,000 Words.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/C9DQFSYT/papers.html",,,Information Security; Information System Research; Manipulation Checks; Mechanical Turk; Online Research; Online Surveys; Survey Experiment; Treatment Recall Bias; Vignette Experiments,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, inspection of workplace aggression scales suggests that many items do not contain face-validity with respect to inclusion of intent to harm. In a series of four studies, this dissertation examines the effect of inclusion of intent to harm on workplace aggression’s psychometric properties, with the ultimate goal to develop a construct-valid measure of aggression. In addition to the focus on intent to harm, this research evaluates the feature of response perspective (i.e., experienced versus enacted aggression) within aggression’s measurement, as well as aggression’s nomological network and factor structure. First, a general sample of working adults is surveyed to judge the degree to which existing workplace aggression scales contain the feature of intent to harm. It is found that existing workplace aggression scales primarily do not contain sufficient levels of intent to harm, indicating a disconnect between conceptual definition and operational measurement of aggression. Second, results from another working sample suggest that inclusion of intent to harm in aggression scales has substantial implications for aggression’s occurrence rate as well as its factor structure. Specifically, prior research that does not assess intent to harm overestimates the frequency of aggression. Third, it is found that workplace aggression’s external correlations are also overestimated when failing to include intent to harm in measures of aggression. It was also found that aggression without intent is highly correlated with a related construct, counterproductive work behavior (CWB), whereas aggression measured with intent is empirically distinguished from CWB. Using data from the second and third studies, a construct-valid workplace aggression scale is devised, coined the Intentional Workplace Aggression Scale (IWAS). The IWAS displayed stronger relationships with affective constructs such as trait anger and emotional stability than the situational variables of job satisfaction and organizational justice perceptions. Additionally, workplace aggression consistently displayed three lower-order facets: verbal aggression, physical aggression, and social undermining. The fourth study represented a cross-validation effort for IWAS findings and was undertaken in a sample of Korean firefighters. Though to a smaller magnitude than in the previous study, findings surrounding the influence of intent to harm on aggression’s occurrence rate and nomological network were replicated. This study also showed moderate support for the factor structure of the IWAS. Finally, findings across multiple studies indicate that among the same individuals, workplace aggression from the victim perspective and the aggressor perspective are moderately to strongly related.",,9/23/22 16:29,10/22/22 20:32,9/23/22 16:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9781392600252,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/7GP6XXF9/Shewach_Developing a Construct-valid Measure of Workplace Aggression.pdf,,,counterproductivity; scale development; social undermining; workplace aggression; workplace violence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Basis of the study was a field experiment. The experimental setting was a computer assisted mock exam in an introductory course on psychology conducted at a university. The experimental manipulation consisted in inducing two forms of cheating (pre-knowledge, test collusion) in a subgroup of the examinees. As indicators of cheating, we consider well-established person-fit indices (e.g., the U3 statistic), but also several new ones based on process data (e.g., response times). The indicators were evaluated with respect to their capability to separate the subgroup of the cheaters from the remaining examinees. We additionally employed a classification tree for detecting the induced cheating behavior. With this proceeding, we aimed at investigating the detectability of cheating in the day-to-day educational setting where conditions are suboptimal (e.g., tests with low psychometric quality are used). The indicators based on the number of response revisions and the response times were capable to indicate the examinees who cheated. The classification tree achieved an accuracy of 0.95 (sensitivity: 0.42/specificity: 0.99). In the study, the number of revisions was the most important predictor of cheating. We additionally explored the performance of the indicators to predict the specific form of cheating.

The purpose of the current study is to translate the RPI into Chinese (C-RPI) and to study cultural difference in ER by examining structural- and item-level differences in RPI functioning. A total of 930 college students were recruited from China (n = 300), Taiwan (n = 300), and the United States (n = 330). Confirmatory factor analysis was used to study the configural invariance of the RPI and C-RPI. Item response theory-based differential item functioning (DIF) testing was used to study item level differences in functioning between the RPI and C-RPI. Results overall support the established RPI structure in all three regions.

On a bivariate level, social zapping correlated positively with all other measures except for trait FoMO. The results of the multiple regression analysis showed that social zapping was mainly predicted by two dimensions of the Dark Triad, i.e. Machiavellianism and narcissism, as well as attentional impulsivity and the timeliness dimension of procrastination. Based on the results, social zappers can be characterized as individuals who tend to make self-serving and/or impulsive short-sighted decisions at the expense of others.

As such, people often seek feedback from others. To date, feedback-seeking research has emphasized the feedback seeker, identifying traits and circumstances associated with feedback seeking, whereas far less is known about this process from the feedback source’s point of view. However, we expect that feedback sources will vary in their willingness to allocate effort toward delivering feedback. Specifically, integrating the cost-value framework of feedback with self-regulatory theories of goal prioritization, we predict that effort allocated toward a feedback episode is determined by the feedback source’s perceptions of the feedback seeker’s motives for seeking feedback. Across two complementary studies, we found perceived instrumental motives (i.e., a desire to improve one’s performance) to be positively related to the amount of effort put toward delivering feedback, and perceived image enhancement motives (i.e., a desire to impress the feedback source) to be negatively related to effort allocation. Importantly, Study 1 was a field study in which managers were asked to report on a recent episode in which a subordinate had sought their feedback, and Study 2 used an experimental design in which feedback-seeking motives were manipulated. Thus, the current research makes an important contribution to the literature by considering the often overlooked role that the feedback source plays in the feedback process. Moreover, triangulation of both field and experimental data enhances both the external and internal validity of our conclusions.",8/1/22,9/23/22 16:30,10/5/22 23:13,9/23/22 16:30,813-830,,4,37,,J Bus Psychol,Why Do You Ask?,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/BUHDTSFP/Minnikin et al_2022_Why Do You Ask.pdf,,,Effort; Feedback sources; Feedback-seeking behavior; Feedback-seeking motives,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective The goal of the present study was to determine whether parental ER would predict parents' self-reported emotion socialization practices above and beyond the influence of personality. Method Parents completed a series of self-report measures online. After data cleaning, 104 mothers of children between the ages of 8 and 12 years were retained for analyses. Results Hierarchal regressions revealed that mothers who reported higher levels of ER skills and more frequent use of cognitive reappraisal were more likely to report engaging in supportive response behaviors when controlling for personality.

Conservation of resources theory argues that a key to an effective stress recovery process is the replenishment of resources during off-work time (a weekend in the present study). We test a model of the stress recovery process during a weekend whereby two recovery mechanisms (weekend activities and recovery experiences) improve two personal resources (self-regulatory capacity and state optimism), subsequently affecting psychological outcomes (work engagement and burnout) at the start of the next workweek. Employees (n = 233) from various jobs responded to online surveys before and after a weekend. Controlling for pre-weekend resource levels and psychological outcomes assessed on Friday, the two weekend stress recovery mechanisms (weekend activities and recovery experiences) contributed to improving or maintaining self-regulatory and optimism resources on Monday. Of note, psychological detachment may result in less rather than more of the resource of state optimism on Monday. Monday resource levels were linked to improved work engagement and burnout. As proposed by conservation of resources theory, employees can benefit from participating in activities that replenish resources necessary to meet work demands upon returning to work after a weekend.

Moreover, although expectations did not significantly moderate the mediational pathways, expectations were a significant predictor of depression and anxiety, with those who reported having their expectations rarely met reporting increased experiences of depression and anxiety.

Using transaction data from Nebraska Game and Parks Commission's electronic hunting and fishing license system, we tracked license purchases of Nebraska, USA, resident license holders in 2010 through 2017. We categorized sportspersons by gender and yearly purchases as hunting only (Hunter), fishing only (Angler), a combination of hunting and fishing (Hunter–Angler), or no purchases (Inactive). The probability of movement among active sportsperson groups was limited and varied little based on initial group participation. The Angler group had the greatest probability of an individual transitioning to the Inactive group (females = 0.39; males = 0.33). The Hunter–Angler group had the greatest probability of an individual remaining within the same group (females = 0.65; males = 0.76). There was a relatively low probability of an individual in the Hunter group moving to the Angler group and vice versa (≤0.02). The sportsperson population is dynamic and understanding patterns of sportsperson participation is important for the future of fish and wildlife management in North America.

Drawing from the actor-focused model of justice, as well as the stereotype content model, we argue that employee conscientiousness and agreeableness can impact the extent to which supervisors adhere to normative rules for distributive, procedural, informational, and interpersonal justice, as a result of supervisors’ evaluations of their employees’ effort and their liking of the employees. Supervisory compliance with justice rules may, in turn, impact the extent to which employees judge themselves to be treated either justly or unjustly. We tested these possibilities in 3 studies. In Study 1, we utilized a meta-analysis to demonstrate positive relationships between employees’ conscientiousness, agreeableness, and their justice perceptions. In Study 2, we conducted 3 experiments to test the causal relationship between employee personality and supervisor intentions to comply with justice rules. In Study 3, we conducted an employee–supervisor dyadic field survey to examine the entire mediation model.

The presence of this bias can reduce the informativeness of the reputation system and negatively impact its ability to ensure quality. Design/methodology/approach This research combines survey and experimental methods, collecting data from 1,875 Mechanical Turk (MTurk) workers in five studies designed to investigate the informativeness of the MTurk reputation system. Findings The findings demonstrate the presence of a positivity bias in evaluations of workers on MTurk, which leaves them undifferentiated, except at the extremity of the reputation system and by status markers. Research limitations/implications Because MTurk workers self-select tasks, the findings are limited in that they may only be generalizable to those who are interested in research-related work. Further, the tasks used in this research are largely subjective in nature, which may decrease their sensitivity to differences in quality. Practical implications For researchers, the results suggest that requiring 99 per cent approval rates (rather than the previously advised 95 per cent) should be used to identify high-quality workers on MTurk. Originality/value The research provides insights into the design and use of reputation systems and demonstrates how design decisions can exacerbate the effect of naturally occurring biases in evaluations to reduce the utility of these systems.",1/1/19,9/23/22 16:30,9/23/22 16:30,9/23/22 16:30,195-223,,2,53,,,A panel for lemons?,,,,,,,,,,,,Emerald Insight,,Publisher: Emerald Publishing Limited,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/X38MRTR2/Matherly_2019_A panel for lemons.pdf,,,Data quality; Methodology; Online research; Positivity bias; Reputation systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intended to supplement the existing Political Skill Inventory (PSI; Ferris et al., 2005), the Dark Political Skill Scale captures the more covert and deceptive side of political effectiveness in the workplace. Across three studies, I collected data from independent samples of full-time employees (N = 430, N = 157, and N = 142), representing a variety of occupational backgrounds. The 10-item uni-dimensional Dark Political Skill Scale demonstrated consistent evidence of convergent validity. As expected, it was positively related to (though not redundant with) an array of social competencies (political skill, social skill, self-monitoring, and perceived ability to deceive) and political will. I also found evidence of criterion-related validity as the Dark Political Skill Scale was associated with behavioural outcomes, including greater engagement in counterproductive work behaviour and workplace impression management. Dark political skill also acted as an influential moderator in predicting impression management. Importantly, in comparison to the PSI, the Dark Political Skill Scale demonstrated differential relationships with the variables in the present research. Of note, the personality profiles of employees scoring high on dark political skill showed a different pattern of results than the PSI, such that the former were lower in Honesty-Humility, Emotionality, and Agreeableness. Finally, self- and peer-reports indicated low to moderate convergence for the Dark Political Skill Scale, which was interpreted to be suggestive of the deceptive nature of dark political skill. Taken together, the Dark Political Skill Scale offers a novel theoretical and methodological contribution to the organizational politics literature. Supplementing the PSI, this new scale provides the opportunity for a more comprehensive assessment of workplace political effectiveness, and a greater understanding of the competencies required for successful engagement in a full range of political behaviours.",2016,9/23/22 16:30,10/22/22 17:13,9/23/22 16:30,,,,,,,Towards the Dark Side of Political Skill,,,,,,,eng,"University of Calgary graduate students retain copyright ownership and moral rights for their thesis.

Although technology acceptance models, grounded in broader theories of behavior, do exist, these models fall-short in determining the most proximal antecedents of actual behavior. Currently, the majority of the research in the information technology arena posits behavioral intention as the most proximal antecedent of technology use. Behavioral intention does explain variance in use, but this relationship has been the subject of discussions and research calling for 1) an investigation of potential moderators based on meta-analytic results, 2) the consideration of theoretically meaningfully mediators that may explain the relationship between behavioral intention and behavior, and 3) stronger experimental designs that do not rely on self-reported technology use. To this end, a model was developed that posited that the relationship between behavioral intention and behavior is mediated by implementation plans. Further, it was also hypothesized that the behavioral intention to implementation plans relationship, as well as the implementation plans to behavior relationship, is moderated by computer self-efficacy. To test the hypotheses, approximately 406 participants from a large international organization responded to survey questions intended to assess their behavioral intentions, implementation plans, and computer self-efficacy. Further, participant usage of the technology in question (Microsoft Lync) was assessed by querying their actual use following a one month post-survey lag. The results demonstrated partial support for the complete hypothesized model, with implementation plans mediating the behavioral intentions—behavior relationship. The moderating effect of computer self-efficacy was not supported. Practical implications, directions for future, and limitations are discussed.",,9/23/22 16:30,10/22/22 20:30,9/23/22 16:30,,,,,,,Employee behavioral intention and technology use,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9781339346458,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/4EC6T3XG/Brusso_Employee behavioral intention and technology use.pdf,,,Behavioral intention; Computer self-efficacy; Implementation plans; Organizational technology; Psychology; Social sciences; Technology acceptance; Technology use,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drawing on the emotional process theory of abusive supervision and the more general sociofunctional perspective of emotions, we specify that such a dynamic is more likely to ensue when subordinates otherwise experience the relationship with their supervisors as good (high LMX). Two studies—an experiment and a two-week bi-daily experience sampling study—provide support for our reasoning. As such, our study extends theorizing on the consequences of abusive supervision, which has typically found that it reduces cooperative behaviors.

Acceptability ratings comparing the BASE-6 to the Outcome Questionnaire–45.2 (OQ-45.2; Lambert et al., 1996) are provided. Factor analyses showed the items were well represented by a single factor, indicating a unidimensional factor structure. The BASE-6 demonstrated good internal consistency (α = .87–.93) and there was good test–retest reliability (intraclass correlation = .77) across 1 week. In Samples 1 and 2, there was moderate to high convergent validity with the OQ-45.2 total score (r = .66–.81, p < .001), and Symptom Distress (r = .66–.80, p < .001), Interpersonal (r = .54–.68, p < .001), and Social Role (r = .57–.69, p < .001) subscales. In Sample 3, there was high convergent validity with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (r = .80, p < .001) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder–7 (r = .76, p < .001). BASE-6 item and total scores were generally higher in the clinical sample compared with the nonclinical samples. Participants perceived the BASE-6 as easier to use, and more acceptable on a weekly basis compared with the OQ-45.2. Results provide preliminary evidence that the BASE-6 has acceptable psychometric properties and may show promise in the context of measurement-based care.

Yet, graphs are not equally useful for all individuals, as people differ substantially in their graph literacy—the ability to understand graphically presented information. Although some features of graphs can be interpreted using spatial-to-conceptual mappings that can be established by adults and children with no graphing experience (e.g., “higher bars equal larger quantities”), other features are linked to arbitrary graph conventions (e.g., axes labels and scales). In two experiments, we examined differences in the processes underlying the comprehension of graphs presenting medical information in individuals with low and high graph literacy. Participants' eye movements were recorded while they interpreted graphs in which information in conventional features was incongruent with that conveyed by spatial features. Results revealed that participants with low graph literacy more often relied on misleading spatial-to-conceptual mappings and misinterpreted the data depicted. Higher graph literacy was often associated with more time spent viewing the conventional features containing essential information for accurate interpretations. This suggests that individuals with high graph literacy are better able to identify the task-relevant information in graphs, and thus attend to the relevant features to a larger extent. Theoretical, methodological, and prescriptive implications for customization of decision-support systems are discussed.

Feeling trusted by one’s leader is associated with increased performance, organisational citizenship behaviours and job satisfaction (Baer et al., 2015; Lester and Brower, 2003). Design/methodology/approach Participants read a vignette in which a leader’s behaviour was manipulated and then rated the extent to which they felt trusted. Participants in Sample 1 consisted of 726 undergraduate students with work experience, and Sample 2 consisted of 1,196 people with work experience recruited over CrowdFlower, a crowd-sourcing website. Findings Results from both samples indicate that a leader delegating a task increases subordinate felt trust, for Sample 1 p<0.001, d=0.75 and for Sample 2 p<0.001, d=0.90. Further, subordinate felt trust increases when the task delegated is of high importance, for Sample 1 p<0.001, d=0.42 and for Sample 2 p<0.001, d=0.58. The likelihood of the delegated task resulting in negative outcomes and subordinate propensity to trust have negligible effects on felt trust. Originality/value Despite the organisational benefits of felt trust, it is still unclear how to elicit subordinates’ felt trust. This study is one of the first to empirically examine leader behaviour that may lead subordinates to feel trusted in the workplace. These findings support theoretical underpinnings of the relational leadership model and the risk-based model of trust.",1/1/19,9/23/22 16:31,10/6/22 19:03,9/23/22 16:31,163-176,,2,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Emerald Insight,,Publisher: Emerald Publishing Limited,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/5HJ7T77F/Hanna et al_2019_The effect of leader risk-taking on subordinate felt trust.pdf,,,Delegation; Felt trust; Leader behaviour; Risk-taking; Trust,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, our results suggest that the relationship between experienced incivility and behavioral incivility is conditional on the level of passive leadership, such that the effect of experienced incivility on behavioral incivility is stronger at higher levels of passive leadership.

Mindfulness training interventions (e.g., mindfulness-based stress reduction; MBSR) are commonly implemented for employees within organizations. Mindfulness has been associated with multiple employee performance, relational, and well-being outcomes. Although mindfulness has become a popular practice within organizations, empirical research falls behind and has not explored many potential research avenues. As leaders play influential roles within organizations, mindfulness may influence leader behaviors, to an extent that leader mindfulness affects employees. This study examined the relationship between supervisor mindfulness and leader-member exchange (LMX), which entails quality of mutual support, trust, and respect within supervisor-subordinate relationships. In addition, the proposed study sought to empirically support proposed theoretical frameworks by examining affective, cognitive, and behavioral mechanisms of empathic concern, perspective taking, and response flexibility, as mediators in the supervisor mindfulness-LMX relationship. Supervisor workload was also examined as a moderator to assess conditions under which the supervisor mindfulness-LMX relationship exists. A sample of 202 individuals who currently supervise employees was collected using the online survey platform, Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. Two approaches towards mediation provided support for the mediating roles of empathic concern and response flexibility in the relationship between supervisor mindfulness and LMX.

The present study aimed to illuminate how the general public in Germany reacted to the prospect of increasing the length, the intensity and/or the flexibility of distancing rules implied by different lockdown scenarios. Endorsement of and compliance with five specific lockdown scenarios were assessed in a large (N = 14,433) German sample. Results showed that lockdown length affected respondents' reactions much more strongly than intensity or flexibility. Additional analyses (i.e., mixture distribution modelling) showed that half of the respondents rejected any further extensions or intensifications, while 20% would endorse long-term strategies if necessary.

The relationship between support for school and both work–school conflict (WSC) and work-school enrichment (WSE) were also studied, and in turn, associated outcomes (i.e. grade point average, job satisfaction, general psychological health, and school burnout) of inter-role conflict and enrichment. In a two-wave study of 291 employed college students, we found that individuals high in school-specific core self-evaluations perceived greater organizational support and family support for school, which was associated with decreased WSC and increased WSE (through organizational support). In turn, WSC was related to lower general psychological health and higher school burnout whereas WSE was related to higher job satisfaction.

Complementing these perspectives, we develop a CSR sensitivity framework that explains how task significance, a micro-level job characteristic, can sensitize employees to their organizations’ macro-level CSR efforts, thereby strengthening the association between CSR and OCB. Across three field studies, we find that CSR and task significance interact to predict OCB, such that an organization’s CSR is more positively associated with OCB among employees who report higher task significance than among those who report lower task significance. Furthermore, we find support for prosocial motivation as a mediator of this interactive effect, but we do not find evidence for several alternative mediators.

This practice highlights client improvement and the need for therapeutic adjustments when clients are not improving as expected, resulting in faster symptom reduction, reduced likelihood of client dropout, and improved outcomes. I investigated the psychometric properties of the BASE-6, using (a) two different online community samples, each of which comprised a subsample in psychotherapy as well as a subsample not in psychotherapy and (b) a general university sample. In all samples, I found high correlations with the more extensive OQ-45.2, as well as very strong psychometric qualities.

Habits are automatically triggered behaviours in which we engage without conscious awareness or deliberate control. Although habits help us to operate efficiently, breaking them requires great effort. We have developed a 27-item questionnaire to measure individual differences in habitual responding in everyday life. The Creature of Habit Scale (COHS) incorporates two aspects of the general concept of habits, namely routine behaviour and automatic responses. Both aspects of habitual behaviour were weakly correlated with underlying anxiety levels, but showed a more substantial difference in relation to goal-oriented motivation. We also observed that experiences of adversity during childhood increased self-reported automaticity, and this effect was further amplified in participants who also reported exposure to stimulant drugs.

This concern is based on a conception of method variance as being produced by the nature of the method itself, and therefore, variables assessed with the same method would share common-method variance that inflates observed correlations. In this paper, we argue for a more complex view of method variance that consists of multiple sources that affect each measured variable in a potentially unique way. Shared sources among measures (common-method variance) act to inflate correlations, whereas unshared sources (uncommon-method variance) act to attenuate correlations.

Drawing from the Job Demands-Resources model of work stress, we examined how two personal resources – extraversion and emotional stability – influence relations among intrusions and strain outcomes.Design/methodology: Self-reported, online questionnaire data were collected from two samples; 323 faculty and staff from a university (sample 1) and 574 full-time employees recruited from an online crowdsourcing forum (sample 2).Results: In sample 1 extraversion was positively related to intrusions, whereas in sample 2, extraversion and emotional stability were negatively related to intrusions. There were no interactive effects of personality on relations among intrusions and strain outcomes in sample 1. In sample 2, low emotional stability strengthened relations among intrusions and work tension. Additionally, intrusions were negatively associated with stress for individuals high on emotional stability. Finally, introverts experienced less stress in response to intrusions.Conclusion: Taking a person-situation interactionist approach, we examined personal resources that may mitigate interruption-related strain.

Under time pressure, users are more likely to rely upon fast, affect-driven decision making, increasing their susceptibility to make mistakes and justify non-secure workarounds. This contributes to the role of human error in cybersecurity and counteracts cybersecurity measures (CSMs) designed to protect organisations from threats and vulnerabilities. In this study, we report results from an online survey (N = 207), investigating how users perceive the effectiveness of CSMs for facilitating secure behaviour under time pressure. Understanding how users perceive the effectiveness of CSMs is important to inform the design and implementation of such measures in practice. We find that perceived CSM effectiveness differs greatly across measures. Thereby, users’ appreciation of incident severity and the general level of time pressure in their daily lives emerge as important antecedents.

These studies indicate a strong positive relationship between minority stress and increased mental health concerns. However, little research has been conducted on nonbinary students enrolled in institutions of higher education, despite a growing number of young adults and emerging adults identifying with this label. The current study sought to fill this gap by understanding minority stress among nonbinary students in higher education. The sample included nonbinary students (N = 380), who filled out measures that focused on the impact of minority stress experiences, perceived institutional climate, and sense of belonging. The participants in this study reported higher levels of minority stress compared with sexual and gender minority samples using similar measures. A hierarchical linear regression was conducted to test direct relationships among the constructs. The findings revealed that nonbinary students who did not feel as though they belonged on campus or felt that the climate was positive reported more of an impact of minority stress than those who reported more belongingness and a better climate. These results signify the importance of attending to belongingness and climate when considering ways that institutions of higher education can better welcome and nurture nonbinary individuals. Thus, higher education campuses should include training and programming that focus on nonbinary students to ensure smooth transitions and healthy educational environments.

While these forms of conflict have been discussed as viable areas of expansion in the work-life conflict literature, there has yet to be a systematic empirical attempt to include both energy and emotion as their own distinct dimensions. In the present research, items were identified and/or created to represent energy and emotion-based forms of conflict to explore their feasibility in work-life conflict measurement. Energy and emotion were identified as distinct dimensions of work-life conflict through four studies of construct validation. Collectively, a four-factor solution of time, behaviour, energy, and emotion was supported. Multi-wave data indicated that energy and emotion-based conflicts were incrementally predictive of outcomes, including job satisfaction and job-related burnout, above and beyond other measures.

The purpose of this set of studies was to examine social cognitive forms of aggression in relation to political party affiliation and political candidate endorsement. In Study 1 (N = 1,657), all forms of aggressive social cognitions (hostile attribution, potency, retribution, victimization by powerful others, derogation of target, and social discounting) were significantly associated with one or more political parties in some respect (Democrat, Republican, Independent). In Study 2 (N = 579), participants who endorsed Bernie Sanders reported higher scores on victimization, while participants who endorsed Donald Trump reported scores high on potency (social cognitive forms of aggression were unrelated to support for Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz beyond political ideology). Results suggest that current political division goes beyond mere differences in political ideology as fundamental aggression-related individual differences appear to covary with how partisans see political parties and primary candidates. Implications include the potential application of our findings to better managing political interpersonal dynamics.

Using an experimental design, Study 2 revealed that very briefly instructed mindfulness, relative to active control instructions, also promoted prosocial responsiveness to an ostracized stranger. Study 3 ruled out alternative explanations for this effect of mindfulness, showing that it did not promote empathic anger or perpetrator punishment, nor that the control training reduced prosocial responsiveness toward an ostracized stranger rather than mindfulness increasing it. Study 4 further ruled out the alternative explanation of relaxation in the experimental effects of mindfulness. In all studies, empathic concern mediated the relation between mindfulness and one or both of the helping behavior outcomes. Meta-analyses of the four studies revealed stable, medium sized effects of mindfulness instruction on prosocial emotions and prosocial behavior.

Landers (2014) developed the theory of gamified learning to provide researchers with a framework to explore the effect of gamification on learning outcomes. The present study empirically tested the mediational process of Lander’s (2014) theory of gamified learning as well as proposed and tested an extension to examine the moderating role of an individual difference. Specifically, this study explored the moderating role of goal orientation on the mediational pathway from Assessment game attributes (i.e., badge, progress bar and combined) to self-efficacy to learning outcomes (i.e., declarative knowledge, skill demonstration and job-search self-efficacy). A gamified resume course was developed for this study on a gamification platform called Gametize. Participants were recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and instructed to respond to a pre-course questionnaire containing demographic information and the goal orientation assessment, they were then directed to the Gametize website to complete the gamified resume course after which they were re-directed to Qualtrics to complete a post-course questionnaire collecting job-search self-efficacy measures. Results show there was insufficient evidence to support the predictions based on the theory of gamified learning, and moreover the hypothesized moderating effect of goal orientation. Nonetheless, an interesting outcome of this study was the significant interaction of the badge condition with LGO and APGO, suggesting badges can help improve self-efficacy in a gamified learning experience. A unique contribution of this study is a blueprint for examining individual differences as an extension of the theory of gamified learning.

Additionally, the connection between the PPI-R and other assessment instruments provides comparison and contrast between the options available in assessing psychopathy.",2020,9/23/22 16:45,9/23/22 16:45,9/23/22 16:45,151-171,,,,,,,,,,,Springer International Publishing,Cham,en,,,,,Springer Link,,DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-27188-6_5,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/I2BHJ4EN/Croom_2020_Empirical Findings Relating to Psychopathy.pdf,,,Corporate psychopathy; Five-factor model; PCL-R; PPI-R; Successful psychopathy,"Fritzon, Katarina; Brooks, Nathan; Croom, Simon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, to reduce costs, researchers increasingly collect data online, under conditions that compromise the value of the information provided. Objective measures related to how the study is completed, such as latency (how quickly answers are given), can only be tied to other objective measures (such as the consistency of the answers), but ultimately their relationship to the subject?s utility function is questionable. To address this problem, the authors introduce a mixture modeling framework that clusters subjects based on variances. The proposed model naturally groups subjects based on their internal consistency. The authors argue that a higher level of internal consistency (i.e., lower variance) reflects more engaged consumers who have sufficient experience with the product category and choice task. ?Gremlins,? in contrast, behave such that the noise in their responses overwhelms any signal, leading to a lack of predictive power.

The objective of the current study was to develop and validate a psychometrically robust self-report measurement tool that captures both disorder-independent and disorder-specific RNT. The 22-item Repetitive Negative Thoughts Questionnaire (RNTQ) was evaluated across two non-clinical convenience samples and one clinical sample (total n = 1,551) using a combination of factor analytic approaches. A hierarchical model with four subfactors (Worry, Brooding, Interference, and Pessimistic Fixation) was the best fitting model across the three samples. The RNTQ and its subscales demonstrated excellent internal consistency (α > .88), robust 3-month test-retest reliability (r = .76), and strong convergent validity with self-reported psychopathology symptoms and related constructs (r’s > .5). Participants with probable comorbid anxiety and depression exhibited significantly more RNT than participants with no likely psychopathology (p < .001).

Motivational models of alcohol use suggest that individuals drink in order to alleviate negative affective states or to enhance positive moods or feelings. Deficits in modulating attention toward emotional experience (i.e., involuntary attention to emotion [IAE]); and poor distress tolerance may contribute to maladaptive patterns of substance use (i.e., negative reinforcement). As negative affect increases, those with deficits in the ability to efficiently attend to emotions as well as the inability to withstand distress may seek more external means of regulating unwanted or intrusive emotional experiences via alcohol. It was hypothesized that involuntarily attending to one’s emotions would contribute to negative reinforcement drinking and problems. Coping motives were directly associated with alcohol-related problems, while enhancement motives were directly associated with problems both directly and indirectly via alcohol consumption. The hypothesized interaction between negative affect and IAE to coping motives was conditional upon levels of distress tolerance, with the moderating effect of involuntary attention being significant at high but not low levels of distress tolerance. Distress tolerance exhibited direct, inverse associations with alcohol-related problems. This pathway was significant over and above the direct effects of both coping motives and alcohol consumption. This suggests that while tolerance for emotional distress may reduce negative reinforcement drinking, it also fosters adaptive regulation when intoxicated.

We found that 23.2% of women, 9.6% of men, and 16.7% of nonbinary students reported experiencing SV at least once in the past 12 months. Roughly 6% of both women and men reported perpetrating SV at least once in the past 12 months, and no nonbinary participants reported any perpetration. The findings did not support a fall “red zone” of increased risk of rape and attempted rape for first- and second-year students. Women’s victimization did not vary by race, international student status, sexual identity, or disability, but second-year women were at increased risk. Overall, most victims of rape and attempted rape were victimized by a man who was not a student on their campus but was known to them (most often a friend, date, or intimate partner). Rapes and attempted rapes were commonly in someone’s home. Women reported significantly greater trauma and academic impact of victimization compared to men.

These techniques have been applied within many domains to date but have only recently been examined in the domain of personnel assessment. By linking workplace-relevant constructs such as general cognitive ability (GCA) to natural language processing outcomes such as word counts, a foundation for language-based psychological assessment of those abilities can be laid. Over 400 participants were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk to write cognitively demanding essays and complete a battery of cognitive tests. Essays were analyzed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). Structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationship between GCA and word count categories as well as the relationship between broad cognitive abilities and word count categories. Latent GCA added incremental prediction of unique word use over latent verbal ability and incremental prediction of preposition use over latent short-term memory. Although not statistically significant, latent GCA and latent verbal ability related to various LIWC word count categories the strongest out of the abilities measured, yielding small to medium effect sizes in both positive and negative directions. Latent short-term memory and latent fluid reasoning were weakly related or unrelated to the LIWC word count categories observed. Word counting approaches to natural language processing may partially express GCA and latent verbal ability, but not latent short-term memory and latent fluid reasoning in cognitively demanding essay contexts.",,9/23/22 16:45,10/22/22 20:34,9/23/22 16:45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9780438455627,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/SJUY5H8F/Armstrong_Word Counts in Response to Cognitively Demanding Essay Prompts as Reflections.pdf,,,Cognitive abilities; Employee selection; General cognitive ability; Language; literature and linguistics; LIWC; Natural language processing; Personnel assessment; Psychology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on these evaluations, we choose whether we want to interact any further, and if we do, what type of relationship we want to have. Although such choices can have far-reaching consequences, we typically base them on tacit knowledge. Our abilities to reason about our own and others’ personalities—abilities theorized to be part of a personal intelligence (Mayer, 2008)—determine in part the relationship outcomes we experience. The existence of such an intelligence implies that people have a “database” they consult when making personality-relevant decisions. This raises the question: Can people readily recall events in which they learned about someone else’s personality? In three studies, I show that most college students described an episode that taught them about positive and negative personality characteristics. The perceived costs and benefits associated with the target predicted whether the relationship strengthened or weakened after learning took place (Studies 2 and 3). Moreover, independent trained judges detected differences in sophistication significantly related to ability-based personal intelligence (Study 3). These findings suggest that people, with varying nuance, note personality information that they perceive as making another person a suitable or useful social companion. People also infer life lessons from their everyday “personality education.”",,9/23/22 16:46,10/22/22 19:48,9/23/22 16:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9781369805314,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/96A9679C/Allen_Personal Intelligence and Learning about Personality in Everyday Life.pdf,,,Interpersonal distance; Learning; Personal intelligence; Personality; Psychology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Occupational stress literature concerning this stressor reveals that interpersonal conflict can have adverse outcomes for organizations including absenteeism, turnover, and workers’ compensation claims for psychological injury. Accordingly, researchers have developed measures aimed at capturing perceptions of workplace interpersonal conflict to remediate and prevent it in organizations. Although workplace interpersonal conflict has received considerable attention, there is little research assessing perceptions of conflict from a dyadic perspective in lateral (coworker-coworker) and hierarchical (supervisor-subordinate) relationships between supervisors and non-supervisors. This is important because conflict may be perceived more frequently or intensely between two individuals, compared to a group or organizational team, based on previous research indicating that individuals perceive and experience conflict differently in dyads and groups. The Workplace Interpersonal Conflict Scale was used to compare perceptions of the frequency and intensity of lateral and hierarchical workplace interpersonal conflict among supervisors and non-supervisors in various industries, providing further validity evidence for the instrument. It was expected that supervisors in hierarchical relationships would perceive the most frequent and intense conflict with a subordinate. However, results revealed that participants (i.e., supervisors and non-supervisors) in hierarchical relationships, regardless of whether they were higher or lower in the hierarchy, perceived significantly more frequent conflict than participants in lateral relationships with no significant differences for conflict intensity.

Research has generally supported the construct validity of the PATD and its capacity for predicting an important, deceit-related behavior, Counterproductive Work Behavior (CWB). However, concerns have been raised that the predictiveness of faking-related measures such as the PATD may be due to their overlap with General Mental Ability (GMA), rather than their own unique variance. In a sample of 198 individuals with work experience, we showed that the PATD is distinct from GMA, and predictive of CWB, even when GMA is accounted for.

There are a number of dementia education and awareness initiatives aimed at reducing stigma, though they have not been robustly evaluated to establish the impact on dementia attitudes or suitability in adolescent populations. This study explored the efficacy and satisfaction of one such initiative (Dementia Friends) in a British adolescent sample. Methods: 301 adolescents (M = 12.6 years old, SD = 0.73) were assigned to either receive Dementia Friends (a 60min interactive class that teaches about dementia and its effects on people’s lives) or education as usual. All participants completed a series of validated questionnaires pre- and post-intervention, related to dementia attitudes (Brief A-ADS and KIDS). Results: Adolescents in the dementia awareness group showed little to no improvements between time-points. The change scores in the dementia awareness group did not significantly differ to the control group based on both KIDS (d = − 0.003, p = 0.98) and Brief A-ADS (d = 0.14, p = 0.13) measures. There was no Group x Time effect after controlling for confounding variables. Conclusions: Dementia Friends is successful in terms of reach and impact, though this study suggests that it may fall short of achieving its goal of improving attitudes towards dementia.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether political skill and ambition interact with narcissism to attenuate or exacerbate workplace deviance. Design/methodology/approach The authors surveyed a sample of 335 participants in leadership positions and empirically tested interactions among political skill, narcissism and ambition in predicting workplace deviance. Findings The authors performed moderated hierarchical regression analyses on the data to test the hypothesis and research question. Contrary to expectations, political skill attenuated the relationship between narcissism and workplace deviance. However, ambition was found to attenuate deviance, with the highest levels of deviance evident when narcissism was high, political skill was low, and ambition was also low. Originality/value Although research has examined the relationship between narcissism and workplace deviance, to the authors’ knowledge, the study is the first to examine the roles of political skill and ambition in attenuating the manifestation of narcissism into workplace deviance.",1/1/22,9/23/22 16:46,10/6/22 19:09,9/23/22 16:46,422-434,,3,43,,,Ambition,,,,,,,,,,,,Emerald Insight,,Publisher: Emerald Publishing Limited,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/M49YW8EG/Davison et al_2022_Ambition.pdf,,,Ambition; Leadership; Narcissism; Political skill; Workplace deviance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More specifically, the focus was on the possibility that the associations these social worldviews had with attitudes toward peace may be mediated by the ideological attitudes of right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation as well as the perceived threat from the Palestinians in a large community sample of Israelis (N = 1,236). The results of a serial parallel multiple mediation analysis revealed partial support for our hypotheses. As expected, the association that the dangerous social worldview had with attitudes toward peace with the Palestinians was mediated by right-wing authoritarianism and perceived threat from the Palestinians. However, the association that the competitive social worldview had with attitudes toward peace with the Palestinians differed from our expectations. More specifically, the competitive social worldview had a negative indirect association with attitudes toward peace with the Palestinians through both right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation but there was also an unexpected positive indirect association through perceived threat from the Palestinians. Discussion focuses on the implications of these results for understanding the roles that ideological attitudes and perceived threat may play in the connections between the social worldviews of Israelis and their attitudes toward peace with the Palestinians.

Across two studies (N = 1,092 and 578) and different SJTs, personality and cognitive ability were equally important determinants of SJT performance regardless of whether situation descriptions were presented or omitted. The effects of removing situation descriptions on the criterion-related validity of SJT scores differed depending on the breadth of the criteria. For predicting global job performance criteria (in-role performance and organizational citizenship behavior), SJT validity was not significantly affected, whereas it decreased for predicting more specific criteria (interpersonal adaptability, efficacy for teamwork). Finally, the effects of omitting situation descriptions in SJTs on applicant perceptions were either negligible or small. Implications for SJT theory, research, and design are discussed.

BIPS subscale scores demonstrated good internal reliability, test–retest reliability, and both incremental and convergent validity with measures of body image, self-esteem, and depressive symptomatology.

Prior research has demonstrated that social reminiscing might serve a protective function for externalizing outcomes in childhood, theorized to function through reduced emotion dysregulation and increased autobiographical memory specificity. However, research has not yet examined these relationships among emerging adults. The present study examined whether social reminiscing was associated with fewer externalizing outcomes among emerging adults including aggression and alcohol-related consequences, as mediated by emotion dysregulation and autobiographical memory specificity. Undergraduate students (N = 404) attending a predominantly White, Midwestern university completed an online autobiographical memory task and self-report survey. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that more social reminiscing was directly related to less emotion dysregulation and indirectly related to less reactive aggression, proactive aggression, and alcohol-related consequences as mediated by emotion dysregulation. Additional exploratory SEM accounting for posttraumatic stress symptoms in response to the COVID-19 pandemic revealed that more social reminiscing was directly related to less emotion dysregulation and indirectly related to less reactive aggression as mediated by emotion dysregulation, but social reminiscing was not related to proactive aggression or alcohol-related consequences. With and without accounting for posttraumatic stress, autobiographical memory specificity was not related to social reminiscing, emotion dysregulation, reactive aggression, proactive aggression, or alcohol-related consequences. The present results provide initial support for social reminiscing as a protective factor for emotion dysregulation, and consequently, externalizing outcomes such as aggression and alcohol-related consequences among emerging adults. Though, posttraumatic stress in response to the COVID-19 pandemic complicates these relationships. Future research should examine whether targeting social reminiscing decreases emotion dysregulation and externalizing outcomes. Further, future research should consider the impact of posttraumatic responses to the COVID-19 pandemic on relationships between social reminiscing, emotion dysregulation, and externalizing outcomes.",2021,9/23/22 16:46,10/22/22 20:13,9/23/22 16:46,,,,,,,Social Reminiscing,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798460407293,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/F6MB4KDN/Klesel_Link to external site_2021_Social Reminiscing.pdf,,,Alcohol-related consequences; Autobiographical memory specificity; Emotion dysregulation; Proactive aggression; Reactive aggression; Social reminiscing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent findings suggest competition over resources lead Machiavellians to secure their superior's approval, promoting their career advancement. However, the strategies Machiavellians use in such contexts have yet to be identified. Social undermining research suggests that undermining one's coworkers might make it difficult for targets of undermining to maintain effective working relationships while promoting a perpetrator's relative status (Duffy, Shaw, Scott, & Tepper, 2006). Thus, drawing on trait activation theory, we argue that resource constraints motivate Machiavellians to undermine their coworkers, which might help them achieve higher relative status. Additionally, with increased effort devoted toward undermining one's peers, Machiavellians should be distracted from performing core duties resulting in increased production deviance. Data collected from 170 employees supported our arguments. Our study addresses a gap in the literature by suggesting that Machiavellians successfully navigate competitive work environments by undermining their coworkers.

The primary hypothesis of interest was to determine if heavy use of ICT for communicating with one’s leader directly results in lower LMX quality. Additionally, it was hypothesized that technology acceptance, transformational leadership, and personality facets may serve as moderators of the ICT-LMX relationship. Data were collected across two time-points from a US sample of 227 participants from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. Hypotheses for the direct and moderating effects between ICT use and LMX were not supported. However, LMX was a significant predictor of leadership satisfaction, communication satisfaction, and turnover intentions. Structural equation modeling also revealed that technology acceptance partially mediates the relationship between both ICT use and media quality on the prediction of LMX quality, resulting in a good fitting SEM model. Based on analyses, when controlling for the effects of technology acceptance, ICT use does in fact directly negatively impact LMX quality, such that the more ICTs are used to communicate between leader and subordinate, the less likely they will have a high-quality relationship. While technology may have a negative impact on relationship quality, this finding does not occur in isolation and the impact of other factors is necessary to further explain this effect.

Additionally, many college students engage in problematic alcohol use. There is evidence that individuals with co-occurring PTSD symptoms and alcohol and other substance use disorders often use substances in an attempt to reduce their PTSD symptoms, and college students with PTSD symptoms experience more negative alcohol and drug consequences than those without PTSD. The relationship between PTSD and alcohol and other substance use disorders is often cyclical: individuals use substances to cope with PTSD symptoms, which in turn exacerbate symptoms and make them vulnerable to further traumatic experiences. Mindfulness interventions have been successfully utilized for individuals with PTSD or substance use disorders. However, to date, no previous studies have evaluated treatments for college students with co-occurring PTSD symptoms and problem drinking. This study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a 4-week group loving-kindness meditation (LKM) compared to referral to treatment as usual (RTAU) for college students with PTSD symptoms and problem drinking. Seventy-six college students participated in the current study. Overall, the LKM group was feasible and acceptable to college students, although recruitment of eligible students into the study was lower than expected and attendance at LKM groups was modest. Participants’ PTSD symptoms, drinking quantity, and negative drinking consequences decreased over the course of the study, although there was no significant differences between the LKM and RTAU conditions on these outcomes. Additionally, higher coping drinking motives predicted greater PTSD symptoms and more drinking consequences, highlighting the need for early effective intervention for individuals who drink to cope with their PTSD symptoms.",2017-08,9/23/22 16:46,10/22/22 19:10,9/23/22 16:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en_US,none,,,,digital.lib.washington.edu,,Accepted: 2017-10-26T20:53:58Z,,"/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/XQWKI8U4/40699.html; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/V9N9GSTY/Valenstein-Mah_2017_Feasibility, acceptability, and outcomes of a brief mindfulness intervention.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although much research has been done on response time models, there is large variability between assessments and the factors that may affect response times. On the person’s side, familiarity with online environments may largely predict response times. On the item’s side, item type and number of words in item stem may account for a substantial variability in response times. In this dissertation, an explanatory framework for response time modeling is proposed. Among the advantages, this explanatory approach provides a more interpretable model for understanding variability in response time due to person or item characteristics, while decreasing the number of parameters to be estimated. Furthermore, including additional information when modeling response times may improve estimation of one’s working speed. Using survey data from a high school sample, we explore also response times, background variables, and process data to illustrate this explanatory framework.

However, only a few of these apps have undergone adequate validation. As with many mobile apps, healthcare apps are generally considered safe to use, making them easy for developers and end-users to exchange them in the marketplace. The existing platforms are not suitable to collect reliable data for evaluating the effectiveness of the apps. Moreover, these platforms only reflect the perspectives of developers and experts, not of end-users. For instance, data collection methods typical of clinical trials are not appropriate for participant-driven assessment of healthcare apps because of their complexity and high cost. Thus, we identified a need for a participant-driven data collection platform for end-users that is interpretable, systematic, and sustainable —as a first step to validate the effectiveness of the apps. To collect reliable data in the participatory trial format, we defined distinct stages for data preparation, storage, and sharing. Interpretable data preparation consists of a protocol database system and semantic feature retrieval method to create a protocol without professional knowledge. Collected data reliability weight calculation belongs to the systematic data storage stage. For sustainable data collection, we integrated the weight method and the future reward distribution function. We validated the methods through statistical tests conducted on 718 human participants. The validation results demonstrate that the methods have significant differences in the comparative experiment and prove that the choice of the right method is essential for reliable data collection. Furthermore, we created a web-based system for our pilot platform to collect reliable data in an integrated pipeline. We validate the platform features with existing clinical and pragmatic trial data collection platforms. In conclusion, we show that the method and platform support reliable data collection, forging a path to effectiveness validation of digital healthcare apps.",2/14/20,9/23/22 16:47,10/22/22 19:02,9/23/22 16:47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,"© 2020, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

In a replication study (N = 211, Study 1), we showed that students naturally tend to develop simplified, low variety work. In 2 further simulation studies, we quantitatively assessed participants’ work design behaviors via 2 new measures (“enriching task allocation” and “enriching work strategy selection”). As a comparison measure, we assessed individuals’ tendency to choose individualistic rather than work design strategies (“person-focused strategy selection”). We then investigated how work design behaviors are affected by capacity (professional expertise, explicit knowledge, job autonomy) and willingness (life values). For a sample of human service professionals (N = 218, Study 2), participants scored higher on enriching task allocation and enriching work strategy selection if they had expertise as an industrial/organizational psychologist and if they had high autonomy in their own job. Explicit knowledge about work design predicted lower scores on person-focused strategy selection, and mediated the effects of professional expertise on this outcome. Individuals high in openness values scored higher on enriching work strategy selection, and those high in conservation values scored lower on enriching task allocation. These findings were replicated in Study 3 among working professionals (N = 602). We then showed that openness to change values predicted enriching work strategy selection via the more proximal processes of valence (valuing intrinsic work characteristics) and affect (positive affect when enriching others’ work).

Thus, the current study tested intervention effects (moderated by gender) of an online, university-specific PFI for high-risk cannabis users (i.e., past-month cannabis users with at least one recent cannabis-related problem) who were randomly assigned to an online PFI (n = 102) or an online personalized normative feedback-only condition (PNF-only; n = 102). Gender moderated the relationship between condition and one-month follow-up problems, such that women in the PFI condition reported fewer cannabis-related problems at follow-up than women in the PNF-only condition.

Many organizations seek to solve the problem of WFC in their employees by instituting flexible work arrangements (FWA), such as scheduling flexibility benefits (i.e., flextime and compressed workweeks) and location flexibility benefits (i.e., flexplace, otherwise known as telecommuting). However, literature in the work-life domain suggests that the mere availability of formal flexibility benefits may not be enough; rather, informal work-life supports, such as supervisor and organizational support of work-life balance, are consistently found to directly and indirectly reduce WFC in employees (Allen, 2001). Inspired by this stream of literature, this study explored the impact of work-life supportive work environments on employees’ WFC. Specifically, using a non-experimental, time-lagged online survey research design, the present study tested the direct and indirect effects of gender, family supportive organizational cultures, and family supportive supervisory behaviors on WFC via FWA use and psychological empowerment, as well as the moderating role of gender in the relationships between organizational and supervisor support and work-family outcomes. The proposed mediation and moderation models were tested using data collected from a sample of 294 full-time employees in the United States. The results suggest that reducing employees’ WFC is more complicated than simply instituting formal work-life policies and instead, a confluence of individual difference factors, such as gender, informal work-life supports, such as organizational and supervisor support, and cognitive/affective states, such as psychological empowerment, act to reduce employees’ WFC. Furthermore, this study suggests that previously equivocal findings regarding gender differences in WFC may be an artifact of the dominating measurement device (i.e., perceptual measures of WFC), as a newly validated behavioral assessment of WFC showed increased sensitivity at detecting gender differences in WFC, as compared to the ubiquitous perceptual measure.",2019,9/23/22 16:48,10/22/22 19:54,9/23/22 16:48,,,,,,,Promoting Work-life Balance Through Context,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798597006840,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/8CYFQJMW/Pineault_2019_Promoting Work-life Balance Through Context.pdf,,,Empowerment; Flexible work arrangements; Supervisor support; Work-life balance; Work-life organizational culture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To do this, we employed three sentiment analysis techniques: Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count 2015, SentimentR and SentiStrength, and quantified the forms of measurement error they introduced: specific factor error, algorithm error and transient error. We conducted an initial test of the text-based measures’ validity, assessing their convergence with closed-question job satisfaction measures. We adopted a time-lagged survey design (Nwave 1 = 996; Nwave 2 = 116) to test our hypotheses. In line with our hypotheses, we found that specific factor error is higher in the open question text-based measure than in the semi-open question text-based measure. As expected, algorithm error was substantial for both the open and semi-open question text-based measures. Transient error in the text-based measures was higher than expected, as it generally exceeded the transient error in the human-coded and the closed job satisfaction question measures. Our initial test of convergent and discriminant validity indicated that the semi-open question text-based measure is especially suitable for measuring job satisfaction. Our article ends with a discussion of limitations and an agenda for future research.",12/26/19,9/23/22 16:48,9/23/22 16:48,9/23/22 16:48,e0226408,,12,14,,PLOS ONE,,,,,,,,en,,,,,PLoS Journals,,Publisher: Public Library of Science,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/7D3I68R6/article.html; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/4TYLPBUU/Wijngaards et al_2019_The promise of open survey questions—The validation of text-based job.pdf,,,Algorithms; Computer software; Emotions; Jobs; Labor studies; Psychology; Software tools; Surveys,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, we lack a clear understanding of the response strategies and factors that determine response strategies' impact. To address this issue, we introduce image repair theory (IRT) as a promising theoretical foundation in the study of employer response. Using an experimental design, we tested the effects of IRT's general image repair strategies (i.e., Denial, Evasion of Responsibility, Reducing Offensiveness, Corrective Action, and Mortification) and the mechanisms underlying these effects according to IRT. Moreover, we explored the role of review content (i.e., the type of employer image information the review entails) as a contingency factor. We found differences between Denial, Corrective Action, and Mortification, which show that the choice of response strategies can matter and that the relationship between response strategy and potential applicants' perceptions of organizational attractiveness is mediated by attributions of responsibility rather than by perceived offensiveness. In addition, our results suggest that when negative reviews contain information about instrumental rather than symbolic employer image attributes, potential applicants can attribute more responsibility to the employer. Furthermore, only the effects of Reducing Offensiveness and Mortification were dependent on the review's content.

Method Across two samples of adults (N’s = 171 and 191), we examined how rumination and emotion-related impulsivity relate to suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and NSSI. We assess the more general process of repetitive negative thinking and the more specific process of suicide-related rumination.

Institutional surveys are an important means for assessing student learning experiences and outcomes in higher education. With the widespread ownership of smartphones and tablets, a growing number of students use mobile devices to complete institutional surveys. Using National Survey of Student Engagement data collected at a large four-year research university, this study examines how survey response patterns and data quality are different between computer (i.e., laptop, desktop) and mobile device responses. The findings indicate that mobile respondents are likely to take a longer time to complete the survey and have higher item nonresponse rates. In examining engagement indicator subscales, first-year students who used mobile devices reported significantly lower internal consistency reliability of all measures in academic challenges compared to computer respondents. Additionally, controlling for student demographics and precollege traits, the adjusted means of academic challenges and supportive environment subscales were significantly lower for mobile device respondents from first-year students.",4/1/20,9/23/22 16:54,9/23/22 16:54,9/23/22 16:54,61-84,,2-Jan,10,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,scholarlypublishingcollective.org,,Publisher: Duke University Press,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/SQGSBMCM/Comparison-of-NSSE-Data-Obtained-via-Computer.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is mostly due to the high costs associated with manual coding and difficulties that arise when validating text measures. Recently, advances in computer-aided text analysis have enabled researchers to rely less on manual coding to construct text measures. Yet, little is known about the validity of text measures generated by computer-aided text analysis software and only a handful of studies have attempted to demonstrate their added value. In light of this gap, drawing on a sample of 395 employees, we showed that the responses to a semi-open job satisfaction question can reliably and conveniently be converted into a text measure using two types of computer-aided sentiment analysis: SentimentR, and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) 2015. Furthermore, the substantial convergence between the LIWC2015 and, in particular, SentimentR measure with a closed question measure of job satisfaction and logical associations with closed question measures of constructs that fall within and outside job satisfaction’s nomological network, suggest that a semi-open question has adequate convergent and discriminant validity.

The interpersonal theory of suicide (IPT) was derived to explain the progression of suicidality by positing that thwarted belongingness (TB) and perceived burdensomeness (PB), combined with hopelessness about these states (interpersonal hopelessness), lead to active suicidal ideation, which in turn leads to suicidal behaviors. However, no prospective tests of IPT hypotheses have utilized a measure of interpersonal hopelessness. Additionally, IPT neglects factors that may protect against or explain the progression of suicidality, such as meaning in life. The purpose of the current study was to extend IPT by examining the ability of the joint TB x PB x interpersonal hopelessness interaction to predict future suicidal desire, also termed active suicidal ideation. An additional purpose was to test whether meaning in life buffers the relationship between TB, PB, and interpersonal hopelessness, which would in theory stop the progression to active suicidal ideation. Exploratory analyses were also conducted to examine the alternative possibility that meaning in life mediated relationships between TB, PB, and interpersonal hopelessness or postulated relationships between other constructs in IPT. A broad sample was obtained through a university in the Southeast, social media, and Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Self-report questionnaires of all constructs were administered twice, in two waves separated by approximately 8 weeks. Because only 53 participants completed valid wave 2 measures, analyses were conducted on 285 wave 1 participants. Hierarchical multiple regression and the PROCESS macro (Hayes, 2022) were utilized to examine hypotheses and exploratory research questions. The two-way PB x interpersonal hopelessness interaction predicted increased active suicidal ideation, such that, at higher levels of PB, interpersonal hopelessness was a stronger predictor of active suicidal ideation. Other hypotheses were not supported: Meaning in life did not buffer relationships between TB, PB, and interpersonal hopelessness; and neither the TB x interpersonal hopelessness interaction nor the TB x PB x interpersonal hopelessness interaction predicted active suicidal ideation.

Excessive anger or anger which is expressed in maladaptive ways present particular challenges for college students due to their developmental stage, stressors, and environmental demands. Unfortunately, too few college students utilize available mental health resources. Individuals with problem anger are influenced by unique factors that affect help seeking decisions. A better understanding of these factors could facilitate outreach and improve service utilization. This study continued the development of the Attitudes Toward Anger Management Scale (ATAMS), a brief self-report measure designed to assess attitudes toward anger management services. Confirmatory factor analysis was utilized with a sample of undergraduate volunteers ( N = 326) to validate the two-factor structure of the ATAMS.

Prior work has explored how people believe algorithmic decisions should be made, but there is little understanding of how individual factors like sociodemographics or direct experience with a decision-making scenario may affect their ethical views. We take a step toward filling this gap by exploring how people's perceptions of one aspect of procedural algorithmic fairness (the fairness of using particular features in an algorithmic decision) relate to their (i) demographics (age, education, gender, race, political views) and (ii) personal experiences with the algorithmic decision-making scenario. We find that political views and personal experience with the algorithmic decision context significantly influence perceptions about the fairness of using different features for bail decision-making. Drawing on our results, we discuss the implications for stakeholder engagement and algorithmic oversight including the need to consider multiple dimensions of diversity in composing oversight and regulatory bodies.",9/5/22,9/23/22 16:55,10/22/22 19:01,9/23/22 16:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv:2005.00808 [cs],,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/9BFBDTS4/2005.html; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/BFQFI9UU/Grgić-Hlača et al_2022_Dimensions of Diversity in Human Perceptions of Algorithmic Fairness.pdf,,,Computer Science - Computers and Society; Computer Science - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BS2ZCPGF,journalArticle,2019,"Williams, Caitlin",Effects of repeated exposure to graphic suicide news articles on explicit and implicit measures of suicide risk,Dissertations,,,,https://etd.auburn.edu//handle/10415/6878,"Existing observational research suggests that following media portrayal of a suicide, there  is an increase in imitative suicidal behaviors (e.g., Gould, 2001; Pirkis & Blood, 2001; Stack,  2005). Despite a plethora of observational research, to date, only two experimental studies have  evaluated the effects of exposure to suicide news articles (i.e., Anestis et al., 2015; Williams &  Witte, 2017). Both of these experimental studies reported findings inconsistent with  observational research, finding no evidence of an imitative effect. However, there were a number  of limitations with the previous experimental designs. As such, our goal in the current study was  to improve upon existing experimental research in order to develop a more concrete  understanding of imitative suicidal behaviors following exposure to suicide news articles. In the  current study, we evaluated the effects of exposure to a series of suicide news articles on a  variety of outcome variables including explicit measures of suicide risk (i.e., affect, suicidal  ideation, depressive symptoms, attitudes toward suicide) and a measure of implicit associations  with suicide (i.e., Death/Suicide Implicit Association Task). We also evaluated whether  individual vulnerabilities (i.e., lifetime history of suicidal ideation/attempt) moderated these  relationships. Data were collected from 420 participants. Of all outcome variables, only changes  in affect were affected by exposure to suicide news articles (i.e., positive affect decreased for the  suicide condition and negative affect decreased for those in the control condition). We also did  not find any moderation effect of individual vulnerabilities, such as lifetime suicidal ideation and  behavior. Overall, our study addresses many of the limitations of previous experimental studies   and provides important information about the immediate impact of exposure to suicide news  articles on a variety of outcome variables known to be associated with increased risk for suicidal  behavior. However, the discrepancy between findings of experimental and observational studies  remains. Future research should aim to address this gap and explore additional explanations for  the differences between experimental and observational designs.",7/23/19,9/23/22 16:55,10/22/22 17:55,9/23/22 16:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,etd.auburn.edu,,Accepted: 2019-07-23T18:46:48Z,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/53QUYNX3/6878.html; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/SNUV8CEW/Williams_2019_Effects of repeated exposure to graphic suicide news articles on explicit and.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is unclear, however, whether performance pressure serves as a productive or unproductive strategy for producing beneficial work behavior. Our research provides clarity on the dynamic nature of performance pressure. We theorize that reactions to performance pressure are influenced by daily fluctuations in how the pressure is appraised, and these fluctuations explain why performance pressure can be a double-edged sword, producing bright and dark side effects for organizations. We predict that, on a daily basis, performance pressure may be appraised as a threat, which promotes self-regulation depletion that explains dysfunctional behavior (i.e., incivility); daily performance pressure may also be appraised as a challenge, which elicits engagement that explains enhanced task proficiency and citizenship. Trait resilience is predicted to moderate these effects, promoting performance pressure to be appraised as a challenge rather than a threat, which then mitigates the depleting effects that produce dysfunctional behavior and enhances the engaging effects that produce functional behavior. Results from an experience sampling study support our predictions.

Van",Let’s talk about pain catastrophizing measures: an item content analysis,PeerJ,,2167-8359,10.7717/peerj.8643,https://peerj.com/articles/8643,"Background Concerns have been raised about whether self-report measures of pain catastrophizing reflect the construct as defined in the cognitive-behavioral literature. We investigated the content of these self-report measures; that is, whether items assess the construct ‘pain catastrophizing’ and not other theoretical constructs (i.e., related constructs or pain outcomes) using the discriminant content validity method. Method Items (n = 58) of six pain catastrophizing measures were complemented with items (n = 34) from questionnaires measuring pain-related worrying, vigilance, pain severity, distress, and disability. Via an online survey, 94 participants rated to what extent each item was relevant for assessing pain catastrophizing, defined as “to view or present pain or pain-related problems as considerably worse than they actually are” and other relevant constructs (pain-related worrying, vigilance, pain severity, distress, and disability). Results Data were analyzed using Bayesian hierarchical models. The results revealed that the items from pain-related worrying, vigilance, pain severity, distress, and disability questionnaires were distinctively related to their respective constructs. This was not observed for the items from the pain catastrophizing questionnaires. The content of the pain catastrophizing measures was equally well, or even better, captured by pain-related worrying or pain-related distress. Conclusion Based upon current findings, a recommendation may be to develop a novel pain catastrophizing questionnaire. However, we argue that pain catastrophizing cannot be assessed by self-report questionnaires. Pain catastrophizing requires contextual information, and expert judgment, which cannot be provided by self-report questionnaires. We argue for a person-centered approach, and propose to rename ‘pain catastrophizing’ measures in line with what is better measured: ‘pain-related worrying’.",3/4/20,9/23/22 16:55,9/23/22 16:55,9/23/22 16:55,e8643,,,8,,PeerJ,Let’s talk about pain catastrophizing measures,,,,,,,en,,,,,peerj.com,,Publisher: PeerJ Inc.,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/9EE5XUL8/Crombez et al_2020_Let’s talk about pain catastrophizing measures.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/7676AWUU/8643.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine whether warnings interacted with psychopathy in predicting faking behavior, we included a warning condition. Findings suggest that faking on the single-stimulus personality assessment was more affected by elevated psychopathy such that those higher in psychopathy were more likely to fake than those lower in psychopathy, however psychopathy was also associated with faking behavior on the forced choice measure.

The present study tested a model in which dark personality traits and trait anger were expected to predict cyber aggression perpetration and moral disengagement was expected to partially mediate these relationships. Emerging adult volunteers (N = 404; 41% men, 59% women) between 18 and 29 (M = 25.16, SD = 2.76) recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk completed an online survey assessing the variables of interest. Structural equation modeling showed that sadism (β = 0.450, p p = .035), and anger (β = 0.099, p = .007) predicted cyber aggression perpetration when taking respondent sex and college enrollment into account, indicating a small effect for anger and psychopathy and a medium effect for sadism. Moral disengagement partially mediated these relationships (24.11% for sadism, 37.23% for psychopathy, and 29.79% for anger). Both trait anger and moral disengagement may be useful in preventing cyber aggression and informing the development of clinical interventions for perpetrators (e.g., anger management, moral reasoning training, improving distress tolerance).

Importantly, relatively heavier employees are often subject to stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination based solely on their weight. These biases may be further influenced by factors such as employee gender and the specific nature of the job. Thus, we employ the stereotype content model (SCM) to examine the multiplicative effects of weight and gender and argue that perceptions of employee warmth are more salient than perceptions of employee competence in customer service contexts. In support of our hypotheses, we found that weight and gender interacted to influence warmth, such that heavy women were perceived to be higher in warmth relative to less heavy women (with no effect for men).

Although mental health care providers may have more awareness of mental health than undergraduates, stigma is prevalent across both mental health care professionals and within universities. Furthermore, suicidality is a particularly stigmatized aspect of mental health. Stigma may affect a client’s willingness to work with therapists who are prosumers. Although client preferences have implications for treatment engagement, retention, and outcomes (Swift & Callahan, 2009, 2010; Swift, Callahan, & Vollmer, 2011), we are unaware of any research that considers clients’ preferences regarding a prosumer therapist. The current study used a delay discounting paradigm to compare undergraduates’ and mental health care providers’ preferences of a prosumer therapist (i.e., with or without prior treatment history or prior suicidal ideation). We hypothesized that mental health care providers would be more accepting of a prosumer therapist, compared to undergraduates. Across both samples we expected a therapist with prior personal therapy to be more preferred than a therapist who has experienced prior suicidal ideation. Results were as expected, which may indicate a greater degree of mental health stigma among undergraduates compared to the mental health profession and greater stigma toward suicide in comparison to therapy experience in general.

Much of the research to date has utilized the Five Factor Model; however, the HEXACO model of personality (Ashton et al., 2004) may offer some advantages in studying aggression. Moreover, the manipulative and often covert nature of relational aggression suggests that the Dark Triad personality traits are likely to be relevant. This study explored the utility of the HEXACO model and Dark Triad in predicting relational aggression in college students' (N=442) peer relationships. Honesty-Humility, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness predicted proactive and reactive relational aggression, and Emotionality also predicted reactive relational aggression. Pathological narcissism and psychopathy predicted proactive and reactive relational aggression while taking respondent gender and the full HEXACO model into account, with vulnerable narcissism and psychopathy serving as positive predictors and grandiose narcissism serving as a negative predictor.

A more recent shift towards followership ""reverses the lens"" by focusing on how followers' perceptions of their role in the leadership process affects the leaders' effectiveness. Servant leadership is a follower-focused leadership style in which the leader's main goal is to selflessly serve followers' needs first and foremost. This study examined the relationships between five personal characteristics and preference for servant leadership, and the mediating effect of followers' implicit leadership theories (ILTs) and implicit followership theories (IFTs) on those relationships. Participants included undergraduate and graduate students who participated as part of an extra credit class assignment. Data were gathered in three phases, each of which were two weeks apart, with the personality characteristic variables being collected in phase 1, the implicit leadership and followership theories at phase 2, and the dependent variable, preference for servant leadership, collected at phase 3. After conducting a factor analysis to evaluate the co-production of leadership scale developed for this thesis, multiple regression analyses were conducted to test hypotheses concerning direct predictors of servant leader preference, and bootstrap analyses were used to test the mediation hypotheses. Additional exploratory analyses included data on the dichotomous choice of the servant leader versus the other leadership styles presented. The results of this study showed limited support that personal characteristics and values are useful in predicting servant leadership preference. Nevertheless, some insights were gained regarding personal characteristics that predicted preference for servant leadership, particularly with regard to proactive personality. In addition, the findings clarified the relationship between co-production of leadership beliefs (IFTs) and prototypical ILTs and anti-prototypical ILTs. Followers who held strong co-production of leadership beliefs also held prototypical ILTs. Conversely, those who held weaker co-production of leadership beliefs held anti-prototypical ILTs. Results suggest that although the characteristics examined in this study were not strong predictors of preference for servant leadership, some characteristics are important and should be examined further. Additional research in this area will expand our understanding of how follower characteristics and context impact preference for a leadership style, allowing for a more holistic understanding of the leadership process.",,9/23/22 16:55,10/22/22 19:11,9/23/22 16:55,,,,,,,Followers' characteristics as predictors of their preference for servant leadership,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9781321247640,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/ETV7ZN8A/Torres_Followers' characteristics as predictors of their preference for servant.pdf,,,Education; Psychology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, research has yet to consider how and why BLMs may result in both beneficial and dysfunctional organizational outcomes. In the present research, we examine employees’ perceptions of top management's BLM as a type of business frame that results in two cognitive states. Under the influence of this business frame, employees may adopt a mental preoccupation with work (i.e., a state of ongoing work-related cognitions) that propels beneficial employee outcomes by reducing customer incivility and enhancing customer service performance. Yet, also in response to top management's high BLM as a business frame, employees may adopt self-interest cognitions (i.e., a cognitive state of self-interest) that instigate customer-directed unethical conduct. Across two field studies, we found general support for our hypotheses. Taken together, our findings suggest that perceptions of top management's high BLM can be a mixed blessing in that it may drive employees to adopt focused work efforts (mental preoccupation with work), but also self-interest cognitions, with each cognitive state predicting beneficial or dysfunctional behaviors.

Trait based measures of EI have been shown to be stronger predictors of OCBs than ability based measures of EI. The goals of this study were to (1) examine possible variables that might be influencing the differences seen between EI types and OCBs (specifically investigating compassion towards others as a moderating variable), (2) explore the relationship among compassion towards others and other commonly studied psychological variables, and (3) test the incremental validity of EI types above the contribution of the Big Five of personality in predicting OCBs. The current study sampled 357 participants who completed an online survey. Data were collected from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Because of the emphasis on work related outcomes in this study, participants were limited to those who are employed and working at least 20 hours a week at the time of the survey. Further restrictions were included for participants by only collecting data from individuals who are at least 25 years or older and live in the United States. Results showed that trait and ability EI are significantly correlated with OCBs and compassion. Compassion was also significantly correlated with OCBs. In addition, trait EI did not show incremental validity in predicting OCBs compared to the Big Five. However, compassion and ability EI taken together did show incremental validity in predicting OCBs compared to the Big Five. Finally, compassion did not moderate the relationship between EI and OCBs. This study was the first to examine compassion towards others as it relates with EI and organizational variables. Findings suggest that compassion is an important factor in predicting the citizenship behaviors of individuals. This study could lead to a greater appreciation in organizational research of using compassion as a predictor of different work outcomes. Additionally, this research may also influence the utilization of compassion in staffing and developmental decisions in fields where OCBs are critical to overall job performance.",,9/23/22 16:56,10/22/22 20:15,9/23/22 16:56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9781088397480,,"/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/4XPDBT3A/Himes_An Investigation of the Relationships among Emotional Intelligence, Compassion,.pdf",,,Compassion towards others; Emotional intelligence; Organizational citizenship behaviors; Positive work outcomes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most participants endorsed significant changes in self-reported reactive criminal thinking with minimal changes in proactive criminal thinking. Neither self-reported pretreatment severity of psychopathology nor self-reported compliance with psychotropic medication predicted response to treatment. Although diagnosis also did not predict responsiveness, more favorable views of treatment predicted greater decreases in criminal thinking. Moreover, those expressing fewer levels of criminal thinking after treatment were also found to express a decrease in attitudes supportive of violence.

A series of confirmatory factor analyses (CFA), reliability analyses, and a nomological net evaluation were conducted to address these aims. The data did not provide support for the hypothesized four-factor model for cyberaggression or cybervictimization (i.e., unwanted contact, malice, deception, and public humiliation). Upon implementing suggested and theoretically supported modification indices, support for a four-factor solution for both cyberaggression and cybervictimization was provided. To subsequently evaluate measurement invariance, single-group CFAs were constructed to test invariance of the four-factor structure across college and high school students. Results provided support for the four-factor model solution of cyberaggression and cybervictimization in the college sample but not in the high school sample. Two cyberaggression subscales (i.e., unwanted contact and deception) correlated at r = .99, indicating the potential for multicollinearity, and incremental fit indices for the cybervictimization model solution did not meet recommended cut-off values in the high school sample. Revised model results based on statistical and theoretical considerations evaluated a restructured three-factor solution for cyberaggression (i.e., “sexual,” “direct,” and “coercion”) and cybervictimization (i.e., “sexual,” “direct,” and “defamation”). Fit indices provided initial support for the revised model solution for both CES cyberaggression items (College: MLM χ2 (163) = 273.01, RMSEA = .04, CFI = .92, SRMR = .06; High School: MLM χ2 (165) = 196.29, RMSEA = .03, CFI = .96, SRMR = .08) and cybervictimization items (College: MLM χ2 (163) = 367.81, RMSEA = .05, CFI = .93, SRMR = .06; High School: MLM χ2 (160) = 256.32, RMSEA = .06, CFI = .92, SRMR = .07). Utilizing the revised factor solution for the remaining analyses, the CES displayed evidence for internal consistency reliability across college (cyberaggression items: α = .83; cybervictimization items: α = .89) and high school (cyberaggression items: α = .88; cybervictimization items: α = .90), although internal consistencies for the CES cyberaggression subscales ranged from poor to good (α = .54–.88) and acceptable to excellent (α = .76–.92) for the CES cybervictimization subscales across both college and high school samples. Evidence for convergent validity with theoretically similar constructs was mixed. Specific areas of model misspecification as well as directions for future cyberaggression measurement research and policy are discussed.",,9/23/22 16:56,10/22/22 20:29,9/23/22 16:56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9781687951786,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/VZ3TK3Y3/Moore_Exploring Construct Validity and Measurement Invariance of the Cyberbullying.pdf,,,College; Construct validity; Cyberaggression; Cybervictimization; High school; Psychometrics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet despite its potential theoretical and practical importance, the belief that men are now the primary target of sexism has not been systematically defined nor has it been reliably measured. In this paper, we define the belief in sexism shift (BSS) and introduce a scale to measure it. We contend that BSS constitutes a new form of contemporary sexism characterized by the perception that anti-male discrimination is pervasive, that it now exceeds anti-female discrimination, and that it is caused by women’s societal advancement. In four studies (N = 666), we develop and test a concise, one-dimensional, 15-item measure of BSS: the BSS scale. Our findings demonstrate that BSS is related to, yet distinct from other forms of sexism (traditional, modern, and ambivalent sexism). Moreover, our results show that the BSS scale is a stable and reliable measure of BSS across different samples, time, and participant gender. The BSS scale is also less susceptible to social desirability concerns than other sexism measures. In sum, the BSS scale can be a valuable tool to help understand a new and potentially growing type of sexism that may hinder women in unprecedented ways.",3/11/21,9/23/22 16:56,9/23/22 16:56,9/23/22 16:56,e0248374,,3,16,,PLOS ONE,Belief in sexism shift,,,,,,,en,,,,,PLoS Journals,,Publisher: Public Library of Science,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/R2HSEM9A/article.html; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/DU24NVDA/Zehnter et al_2021_Belief in sexism shift.pdf,,,Eigenvalues; Factor analysis; Gender discrimination; Pilot studies; Principal component analysis; Psychological attitudes; Psychometrics; Sexual and gender issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
U7U787B6,journalArticle,,"McKibben, William Bradley",Development and validation of the Dynamic Leadership in Counseling Scale - Self Report,Dissertations,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1696289243/abstract/F23C167A0AD34388PQ/1,"Leadership is an important factor in the ongoing success of the profession of counseling. Current issues such as professional identity, counselor education standards, licensure portability, international expansion of the profession, and advocacy initiatives highlight the need for counseling leaders, and the time-limited, voluntary, relationally focused, and positionally diverse leadership roles in counseling distinguish the profession from other disciplines in which leadership has been studied. Further, the lack of a valid and reliable measure limits rigorous understanding and investigation of leadership dynamics within the profession. To begin addressing this gap, McKibben, Umstead, and Borders (2014) conducted a content analysis of counseling leadership literature that yielded three categories of 24 emergent themes of counseling leadership. These themes were identified and organized using the Interpersonal Process Model of Leadership (Eberly, Johnson, Hernandez, & Avolio, 2013), a meta-model of leadership based in developmental notions of dynamic systems. The Dynamic Model of Counseling Leadership (DMCL; McKibben et al., 2014) provided an emergent model in which to ground a measure of counseling leadership, thus paving the way for future leadership research. Based on the DMCL, the author created the Dynamic Leadership in Counseling Scale - Self Report (DLCS-SR), a preliminary self-report measure of counseling leadership, and tested for evidence of reliability and construct, convergent, and discriminant validity. The author developed the items through a sequence of steps (DeVellis, 2003), submitted the initial items to two rounds of review, tested in a small pilot study, and revised items and instructions. In a larger sample of 218 participants (85 counseling students, 69 counselor educators, 57 counseling practitioners, and seven others), tests for reliability (Cronbach's &agr; = .942), convergent validity, and discriminant validity on the DLCS-SR were strong. Based on results from confirmatory and exploratory factor analysis, a hypothesized three factor model of leadership as measured by the DLCS-SR was rejected with this sample, but a single factor model yielded acceptable fit to the data. The author also controlled for socially desirable and inattentive responding patterns throughout the survey. The author also pilot tested the utility of built-in validity scales embedded in the DLCS-SR. A built-in four item social desirability scale did not predict socially desirable responding to the extent of the included Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding - Short Form. Similarly, participant scoring patterns on a built-in two item attentiveness scale were independent of scoring patterns on the included Attentive Responding Scale - 18 inconsistency subscale. In both cases, incidences of social desirability and inattentiveness were infrequent throughout participant responses. The development and initial validation tests for the DLCS-SR provided an empirical basis for research in and training of counseling leadership. Further research is needed with larger and diverse samples within the counseling profession in order to replicate and extend the findings in this study.",,9/23/22 16:56,10/22/22 20:09,9/23/22 16:56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9781321831382,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/TQU3HWZX/McKibben_Development and validation of the Dynamic Leadership in Counseling Scale - Self.pdf,,,Counseling; Dynamic systems; Leadership; Psychology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But do liberals and conservatives in the United States embrace conspiratorial thinking to an equivalent degree? There are important historical, philosophical, and scientific reasons dating back to Richard Hofstadter's book The Paranoid Style in American Politics to doubt this claim. In four large studies of U.S. adults (total N = 5049)—including national samples—we investigated the relationship between political ideology, measured in both symbolic and operational terms, and conspiratorial thinking in general. Results reveal that conservatives in the United States were not only more likely than liberals to endorse specific conspiracy theories, but they were also more likely to espouse conspiratorial worldviews in general (r = .27, 95% CI: .24, .30). Importantly, extreme conservatives were significantly more likely to engage in conspiratorial thinking than extreme liberals (Hedges' g = .77, SE = .07, p < .001). The relationship between ideology and conspiratorial thinking was mediated by a strong distrust of officialdom and paranoid ideation, both of which were higher among conservatives, consistent with Hofstadter's account of the paranoid style in American politics.",2021,9/23/22 16:56,9/23/22 16:56,9/23/22 16:56,23-51,,1,42,,,The Paranoid Style in American Politics Revisited,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/pops.12681,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/IAGPBLRT/pops.html; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/RGGDTX8A/van der Linden et al_2021_The Paranoid Style in American Politics Revisited.pdf,,,conservatism; conspiracy theories; paranoid ideation; political ideology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, the lack of availability of Spanish assessment tools for application in treatment prohibits Hispanic clients from accessing the full extent of available therapeutic resources. The Treatment Support Measure (TSM) is a valid and reliable instrument that allows clinicians and researchers to collect information to better understand change processes and relevant client characteristics in therapy. The present study created a Spanish-translated version of the parent and youth TSM (TSM-SP) and assessed its psychometric properties in a Spanish-speaking community sample of 177 youth and 214 adult caregivers. The internal consistency reliability of all domains of the parent and youth versions of the TSM-SP was good, aside from the Youth Motivation domain. In contrast, the test-retest reliability of all domains of the parent and youth versions of the TSM-SP were generally poor. The construct validity of all domains of the parent and youth versions of the TSM-SP as examined by confirmatory factor analysis was excellent, aside from the Youth Motivation domain. Overall, these results laid the foundation for future research examining the utility and properties of the TSM-SP. The TSM-SP has potential to provide clinicians treating Spanish-speaking youth and families with a useful tool to help better serve these populations in therapy and broaden the scope of research into change processes in youth therapy to involve more diverse populations.",,9/23/22 16:56,10/22/22 19:51,9/23/22 16:56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798662476059,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/4EC2WB84/Ruth_Psychometric Properties of the Spanish Version of the Treatment Support Measure.pdf,,,Community setting; Psychometrics; Routine outcome monitoring; Spanish translation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EEU59E94,journalArticle,2015,"Li, Huiwen",Increasing the number of African American students in undergraduate level classes of Chinese: A call to action,Dissertations,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1796238802/abstract/8D1A1E13A4504075PQ/1,"Chinese language is the only ideographic language remaining in the world (Osaka, 1976). It conveys affluent Chinese culture and has great influences on the East Asian countries (Miyake, 2013). In the economic globalization of the world, China’s economy and international influence are expanding. For these reasons and many more the Chinese language is widely accepted as one of the major world languages. It makes sense then Chinese language classes are experiencing popularity and growth with United States undergraduates. Despite this growth, however, the enrollment of African American students is constantly low in college Chinese language classrooms (Li, Wen, & Xie, 2014). This call to action argues that this low representation of African American students lies on a course promotion system that denies African American students a preliminary learning opportunity that systematically limits their representation in Chinese language classrooms from the beginning. This call for action examines systematic avenues for creating early opportunities. First the study explores the utility of offering African American students an informational workshop introducing the features of the language and the potential benefits of learning it. Next the study examines the leverage that could be gained by providing direct feedback and assessing student interest to explore whether students are more inclined to enroll in Chinese language courses following the information workshop. Such a process could lead to suggested policy changes that might close the enrollment gap between the African American students and their peers. This call for action considers the reality that even a well-designed action plan may not always produce positive consequences. Therefore, an impact evaluation is explored along with suggested instruments and uses. Finally possible outcomes of an impact evaluation are described. To ground this call for action, a set of foundational theories are employed that mainly include networked improvement communities, leadership and teamwork, and critical theories. The call for action strongly suggests the iterative cycle of Plan, Design, Study, and Act (PDSA) of the NIC improvement science (Bryk, Gomez, & Grunow, 2011) in the change process beginning with the examination of a local four-year university Chinese Studies Program.",2015,9/23/22 16:56,10/22/22 20:20,9/23/22 16:56,,,,,,,Increasing the number of African American students in undergraduate level classes of Chinese,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9781339727875 Publication Title: ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/FSCSVQPQ/Li_2015_Increasing the number of African American students in undergraduate level.pdf,,,African American students; Call to action; Chinese language; Class enrollment; Education; Learning opportunities; Social sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, Hepler and Albarracín (2013) introduced a construct that they called “dispositional attitude” and provided validity evidence for a new scale—the Dispositional Attitude Measure (DAM). Although the DAM was introduced as a “new” approach for assessing the dispositional component of attitudes, there is considerable conceptual similarity between it and the Neutral Objects Satisfaction Questionnaire (NOSQ; Judge & Bretz, 1993; Weitz, 1952). In a series of 4 studies, we attempt to replicate the predictive validity of the DAM and empirically examined the distinctiveness of the DAM from the NOSQ. Our findings suggest that the DAM does not consistently predict attitudes (e.g., attitudes toward fictional consumer products, attitudes toward common objects, job satisfaction) after the NOSQ is controlled. As a whole, our results suggest that the DAM and NOSQ assess the same underlying construct and both are valid measures of the dispositional basis of attitudes.

The aim of this paper is to raise awareness of the factors that influence online data quality. This is achieved by 1) identifying factors that can impact the reliability and validity of consumer data obtained with online questionnaires, 2) highlighting indices of online questionnaire data quality that can be used by researchers to assess the likelihood that their data are of poor quality, and 3) recommending a number of indices, counter-measures and best practices that can be used by sensory and consumer researchers to assess online questionnaire data quality and to ensure the highest degree of reliability and validity of their data. By making researchers aware of these sources of invalidity and by presenting available remedies and good practices, it is our intention that sensory and consumer scientists will adopt these measures and report them as a routine part of publishing online questionnaire data.

Because MTurk is a population that learns, we hypothesized that MTurkers would be more attentive to instructions than are traditional subject pool samples. In three online studies, participants from MTurk and collegiate populations participated in a task that included a measure of attentiveness to instructions (an instructional manipulation check: IMC). In all studies, MTurkers were more attentive to the instructions than were college students, even on novel IMCs (Studies 2 and 3), and MTurkers showed larger effects in response to a minute text manipulation.

Estimates of protocol invalidity were derived from a sample of 23,994 protocols produced by individuals who completed an on-line version of the 300-item IPIP representation of the NEO-PI-R (Goldberg, 1999). Approximately 3.8% of the protocols were judged to be products of repeat participants, many of whom apparently resubmitted after changing some of their answers. Among non-duplicate protocols, about 3.5% came from individuals who apparently selected a response option repeatedly without reading the item, compared to .9% in a sample of paper-and-pencil protocols. The missing response rate was 1.2%, which is 2–10 times higher than the rate found in several samples of paper-and-pencil inventories of comparable length. Two measures of response consistency indicated that perhaps 1% of the protocols were invalid due to linguistic incompetence or inattentive responding, but that Web participants were as consistent as individuals responding to a paper-and-pencil inventory. Inconsistency did not affect factorial structure and was found to be related positively to neuroticism and negatively to openness to experience. Intentional misrepresentation was not studied directly, but arguments for a low incidence of misrepresentation are presented. Methods for preventing, detecting, and handling invalid response patterns are discussed. Suggested for future research are studies that assess the moderating effects of linguistic incompetence, inattentiveness, and intentional misrepresentation on agreement between self-report and acquaintance judgments about personality.",2/1/05,9/27/22 20:24,9/27/22 20:24,9/27/22 20:24,103-129,,1,39,,Journal of Research in Personality,,Proceedings of the Association for Research in Personality,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This might be partially because existing approaches to detect careless responding are specialized to detect a certain type of careless response patterns, but fail to detect others. We develop a post-hoc measure, the Lazy Respondents (Laz.R) index, that is based on first-order Markov chains and the idea that careless respondents’ last response can be used to predict their next response. Using large, publicly available datasets to compare our Laz.R index to the most common precautionary and post-hoc measures, we find that (1) the Laz.R index correctly identifies patterns of careless respondents that some or all of the other indices overlook and (2) the Laz.R index avoids false positives (i.e., patterns that are flagged by single other indices, but which seem to capture truthful answering behavior). Furthermore, we suggest an approach to find a sample-specific cutoff value for careless respondents via kneedle algorithm. Finally, we introduce an R Shiny application that provides scholars a simple and readily available means to implement the Laz.R index.",2022-08,9/27/22 21:03,9/27/22 21:03,9/27/22 21:03,15690,,1,2022,,Proceedings,Would I Lie to You?,,,,,,,,,,,,journals.aom.org (Atypon),,Publisher: Academy of Management,,,,,AOM Annual Meeting Proceedings 2022; AOM Seattle 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data were obtained from 2 undergraduate student samples, a self-report group (n = 132) who provided NEO-PI-R self-ratings on 2 occasions separated by a 7- to 14-day interval and an informant group (n = 109) who provided ratings of well-known friends or relatives on 2 occasions separated by a 6 month interval. INC scores from the Time 1 protocols were used to divide these samples into low, moderate, and elevated inconsistency groups. In both samples, these 3 groups showed equivalent levels of reliability and validity as measured by: contingency coefficients for the 20 INC item responses across occasions; test-retest intraclass correlations of NEO-PI-R domain scores; convergent correlations with Goldberg's (1992) Bipolar Adjective Scale scores; and discriminant correlations between the 5 NEO-PI-R domain scores.

An investigation of predictions against point spreads found that people predicted intuitive options (favorites) more often than equally valid (or even more valid) nonintuitive alternatives (underdogs). Critically, though, this effect was largely determined by people's confidence in their intuitions (intuitive confidence). Across naturalistic, expert, and laboratory samples (Studies 1-3), against personally determined point spreads (Studies 4-11), and even when intuitive confidence was manipulated by altering irrelevant aspects of the decision context (e.g., font; Studies 12 and 13), the authors found that decreasing intuitive confidence reduced or eliminated intuitive biases.

Some of the sample sizes presented in Table 1 were incorrectly reported. The correct sample sizes are presented in the erratum.] Previous research suggested that sex differences in personality traits are larger in prosperous, healthy, and egalitarian cultures in which women have more opportunities equal with those of men. In this article, the authors report cross-cultural findings in which this unintuitive result was replicated across samples from 55 nations (N = 17,637). On responses to the Big Five Inventory, women reported higher levels of neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness than did men across most nations. These findings converge with previous studies in which different Big Five measures and more limited samples of nations were used. Overall, higher levels of human development--including long and healthy life, equal access to knowledge and education, and economic wealth--were the main nation-level predictors of larger sex differences in personality. Changes in men's personality traits appeared to be the primary cause of sex difference variation across cultures. It is proposed that heightened levels of sexual dimorphism result from personality traits of men and women being less constrained and more able to naturally diverge in developed nations. In less fortunate social and economic conditions, innate personality differences between men and women may be attenuated.

The results offered partial support for the moderation hypotheses with attachment anxiety but failed to support moderation of attachment avoidance. Specifically, when predicting relationship satisfaction, hostile conflict moderated the effect of attachment anxiety such that high hostile conflict and high attachment anxiety were associated with particularly low current satisfaction. Shifts in hostile conflict over time also exacerbated the longitudinal associations between attachment anxiety and relationship satisfaction.

After evaluating over 250 films, we showed selected film clips to an ethnically diverse sample of 494 English-speaking subjects. We then chose the two best films for each of the eight target emotions based on the intensity and discreteness of subjects' responses to each film.

The best-performing measure incorporates data from the IAT's practice trials, uses a metric that is calibrated by each respondent's latency variability, and includes a latency penalty for errors. This new algorithm strongly outperforms the earlier (conventional) procedure.

In Experiment 1, European-American participants primed with interdependence displayed shifts toward more collectivist social values and judgments that were mediated by corresponding shifts in self-construal. In Experiment 2, this effect was extended by priming students from the United States and Hong Kong with primes that were consistent and inconsistent with their predominant cultural worldview.

Eight well-validated self-report measures of relationship satisfaction, including the Marital Adjustment Test (MAT; H. J. Locke & K. M. Wallace, 1959), the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS; G. B. Spanier, 1976), and an additional 75 potential satisfaction items, were given to 5,315 online participants. Using item response theory, the authors demonstrated that the MAT and DAS provided relatively poor levels of precision in assessing satisfaction, particularly given the length of those scales. Principal-components analysis and item response theory applied to the larger item pool were used to develop the Couples Satisfaction Index (CSI) scales. Compared with the MAS and the DAS, the CSI scales were shown to have higher precision of measurement (less noise) and correspondingly greater power for detecting differences in levels of satisfaction. The CSI scales demonstrated strong convergent validity with other measures of satisfaction and excellent construct validity with anchor scales from the nomological net surrounding satisfaction, suggesting that they assess the same theoretical construct as do prior scales.

Because they typically take hours to complete and require rating hundreds of job tasks, repeating an entire inventory after a short interval is unlikely to produce motivated raters; conversely, increasing the time interval between administrations may result in actual changes in job content that would underestimate the true reliability. By repeating only a portion of the inventory with a very small test–retest interval, rater motivation should not be seriously affected, and changes in job content can be ruled out as a determinant of the results. The repeated item approach was used on 207 respondents and 3 task inventories.

One group completed the entire answer sheet randomly, a 2nd group was instructed to malinger a moderate psychological disturbance, a 3rd group was asked to simulate a severe disturbance, and a 4th group was given standard test instructions. Results showed that MMPI-2 validity scales were sensitive to these response sets: Both random and malingered responses produced significant elevations on F and Fb, whereas only random responding led to significant elevations on VRIN. These results indicated that the source of an elevated F scale may be clarified by referring to VRIN, as VRIN was significantly elevated only in the random response group. Thus, a high F scale score combined with a high VRIN scale score strongly suggests the possibility of random responding. In addition, scores on both F–K and Ds2 (the items remaining from the MMPI Dissimulation scale) increased significantly as degree of simulated disturbance increased. Thus, Ds2 appeared to have sufficient promise as a validity scale to merit further research.

Analyses indicated that the validity indexes lacked utility in this sample. A partial replication (N = 1,728) also failed to find consistent support for the use of validity scales. The authors illustrate the use of informant ratings in assessing protocol validity and argue that psychological assessors should limit their use of validity scales and seek instead to improve the quality of personality assessments.

Design/methodology/approach This general review paper has two parts, namely, descriptive and instructional. The current state of online survey and panel data use in supply chain research is examined first through a survey method literature review. Then, a more focused understanding of the phenomenon of fraud in surveys is provided through an analysis of online panel industry literature and psychological academic literature. Common survey design and data cleaning recommendations are critically assessed for their applicability to narrow populations. A survey of warehouse professionals is used to illustrate fraud detection techniques and glean additional, supply chain specific data protection recommendations. Findings Surveys of narrow populations, such as those typically targeted by supply chain researchers, are much more prone to respondents’ fraud. To protect and clean survey data, supply chain researchers need to use many measures that are different from those commonly recommended in methodological survey literature. Research limitations/implications For the first time, the need to distinguish between narrow and broad population surveys has been stated when it comes to data quality issues. The confusion and previously reported “mixed results” from literature reviews on the subject have been explained and a clear direction for future research is suggested: the two categories should be considered separately. Practical implications Specific fraud protection advice is provided to supply chain researchers on the strategic choices and specific aspects for all phases of surveying narrow populations, namely, survey preparation, administration and data cleaning. Originality/value This paper can greatly benefit researchers in several ways. It provides a comprehensive review and analysis of respondents’ fraud in online surveys, an issue poorly understood and rarely addressed in academic research.

Empirical tests of betrayal blindness and its effects are hampered by the methodological conundrum of how to measure an absence of awareness. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the validity of a novel empirical method to measure implicit betrayed self-concept, the first step in a long-term research aim to operationalize “betrayal blindness.” Informed by betrayal trauma theory, we hypothesized that a history of betrayal within close childhood relationships (but not recent close relationships or “not-close” relationships) would predict implicit betrayed-self associations in young adulthood. An adaptation of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and measured implicit and explicit betrayed-self associations and self-reported history of physical, sexual, and psychological abuse in 529 university undergraduates was designed. Internal consistency reliability of the betrayed self IAT was low but adequate. Hierarchical regression modeling revealed that history of abuse within close childhood relationships (but not recent close relationships or “not-close” relationships) predicted betrayed-self IAT scores. The effect size was small, β = .12, p < .05, 95% CI [.01, .07], R2 = .12. In addition, history of betrayal by someone close (but not someone “not close”) at any age predicted increased explicit evaluations of the self as betrayed versus respected, a small effect size, R2 = .16.

This paper provides psychometric support for the Beliefs About Race Scale (BARS), a multidimensional measure of racial essentialism. Method: Participants included 492 adults recruited on a college campus and in the community. BARS items were developed by the researcher and were subjected to exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, and reliability and validity analyses. Hierarchical regressions examined the relation of BARS subscales to outgroup discomfort. Results: Analyses supported a 4-factor model of racial essentialism, with good internal and test–retest reliability and construct validity. Two BARS subscales predicted outgroup discomfort above and beyond the effects of previous measures of racial and psychological essentialism. Conclusion: Greater specification of racial essentialism offered by the BARS subscales should aid researchers in furthering our understanding of how racial essentialism affects intergroup behavior and the role of education in challenging people’s essentialist beliefs about race.

The authors argue that the linkages between abusive supervision and employee performance occurs via performance-promotion attributions and that employee levels of dispositional forgiveness alter the relationship between abusive supervision and employee interpretations of abuse, such that more forgiving individuals interpret abuse as more benign behavior designed to help them perform better (i.e. are performance promoting). Design/methodology/approach In a three-wave field survey of 318 employees matched with 89 supervisors, employees completed measures of dispositional forgiveness (Time 1) abusive supervision (Time 1), and performance-promotion attributions of abusive supervision's motives (Time 2). Supervisors rated the job performance of their employees (Time 3). Multilevel structural equation modeling was employed to test a multilevel moderated mediation model. Findings The findings indicate abusive supervision predicts diminished employee performance only when employees are low in dispositional forgiveness, explained by lowered performance-promotion attributions for abusive supervision.

The rise in e-cigarette use has motivated research to identify subgroups of the population that may be particularly vulnerable to e-cigarette use and its associated harm. Individuals with elevated psychological vulnerability are one such group more at risk for being a lifetime or current e-cigarette user. Yet, little is known about how factors of psychological vulnerability relate to perceptions of e-cigarette use within the context of e-cigarette quit attempts. The current study evaluated the differential relations of anxiety sensitivity (AS), a core affective vulnerability factor, on several relevant e-cigarette processes across those with and without a previous attempt to quit using e-cigarettes. Methods Our sample consisted of 547 current e-cigarette users (51% female, Mage = 35.38 years, SD = 10.1). Results Results indicated that AS significantly related to greater perceived risks, benefits, and positive outcome expectancies of e-cigarette use among current e-cigarette users who reported at least one attempt to quit e-cigarettes but was unrelated among those who had never attempted to quit. Discussion and Conclusions Findings identify e-cigarette users who fail to quit as a potential vulnerable subgroup of users who experience more strongly held perceptions about e-cigarettes because of increased AS. Scientific Significance This work provides initial evidence for a conceptual model in which levels of AS and e-cigarette processes are strengthened by and differ across e-cigarette quit attempt history.

We introduce a psychometric approach to estimate the minimum age for a child to produce self-report data that is of similar quality as informant data. The approach makes use of statistical validity indicators such as person-fit and long-string indices, and can be readily applied to data commonly collected in psychometric studies of child measures. We evaluate and illustrate the approach, using self-report and informant-report data of the PedsQL, a pediatric health-related quality of life measure, from 651 child?mother pairs. To evaluate the approach, we tested various hypotheses about the validity of the self-report data, using the Gnp person-fit index as the validity indicator and the mother informant-data as a benchmark for validity. Results showed that Gnp discriminated between self-reports of younger and older children, between self-reports of children that completed the PedsQL alone or with a parent, and between self-reports and informant reports. We conclude that the validity-index approach has good potential for future applications. Future research should further evaluate the approach for different types of questionnaires (e.g., personality inventories) and using different validity indices (e.g., response-bias indices).",10/1/20,9/27/22 23:36,9/27/22 23:36,9/27/22 23:36,1604-1618,,7,27,,Assessment,Determining at What Age Children Provide Sound Self-Reports,,,,,,,en,,,,,SAGE Journals,,Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/JYH8DNR3/Conijn et al_2020_Determining at What Age Children Provide Sound Self-Reports.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, models of social support focus on what relationships provide without considering the fit between what people need and receive from their work relationships. Addressing these limitations, we developed and tested a theoretical model of relational attachment at work using a complementary fit perspective. After validating measures, we tested, extended, and replicated our model in three field studies. Results revealed that employees became more attached to their organization and experienced more beneficial outcomes when they had stronger psychological attachment to others at work. This relational attachment was not driven by general social support, but, rather, by “relational needs fit,” which reflects employees’ experience of having their needs met by their work relationships. However, receiving more personal support than what was wanted or needed intruded into employees’ privacy boundaries and created a “too close for comfort” reaction whereby they pulled back from their work relationships. This “too much of a good thing” finding indicates that, while positive relationships at work are effective, social support should be tailored to individuals’ needs.",2019-02,9/27/22 23:36,9/27/22 23:36,9/27/22 23:36,248-282,,1,62,,AMJ,Relational Attachment at Work,,,,,,,,,,,,journals.aom.org (Atypon),,Publisher: Academy of Management,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/A6JVB33S/Ehrhardt_Ragins_2019_Relational Attachment at Work.pdf,,,and affect (general); attitudes; cognitions; organizational behavior (general); person–organization/person–environment fit; satisfaction and commitment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Return rates can vary a great deal across stores within a company and across salespersons within a store. We empirically examine returns across these two levels with respect to three retail service quality dimensions: salesperson friendliness, salesperson competence, and store environment. We conduct a detailed analysis using transaction data and customer survey responses from 25,131 customers at a national jewelry retailer. We find salesperson friendliness, salesperson competence, and store environment are significantly associated with subsequent return events, since, theoretically, customers use the three service quality dimensions as information cues to form their product quality perceptions. Our analysis reveals managerially relevant insights for retailers. The empirical associations suggest retailer management might obtain the most benefit in reducing returns from improving salesperson competence, which is followed by improving store environment and improving salesperson friendliness. We also conduct analyses using customer shopping attributes to identify how retailers might modify service for different customer segments to increase the efficacy of return prevention. Lastly, our counterfactual analysis predicts substantial improvements in return rates and net sales due to potential store execution efforts targeted at improving salesperson friendliness, salesperson competence, or store environment.

Much consideration has been given to the views of mental health professionals regarding the ethical nature of PTG, yet none has been given to perceptions of PTG among recipients or potential recipients of mental health care. This study aimed to examine potential predictors of participant views of PTG (clinician purpose for PTG, clinician gender, participant age, participant gender, and digital privacy attitudes). In addition, the researcher examined whether participant views of PTG differed based on the clinician’s stated purpose for engaging in PTG. Each participant was exposed to three vignettes which depicted a clinician engaging in PTG for the purposes of: clinician curiosity, use of information for treatment planning and therapeutic services, and following significant cause for concern. Participants in this study were 398 adult residents of the United States who had no prior graduate training or employment in mental health fields, all of which were recruited via Qualtrics Panel Recruitment Services. Results indicated the sample held a predominantly negative view of the concept of PTG, regardless of the clinician’s stated purpose. Further, high concern for privacy was found to predict negative views of PTG. Female participants were significantly less likely to view PTG in a positive light. Male clinicians who engaged in PTG were viewed more negatively than female clinicians, although only in non-treatment related circumstances. Contrary to what was initially hypothesized, participant age and prior engagement in mental health services had no bearing on participant views of PTG. Given that the entirety of the sample population rated PTG as a negative phenomenon regardless of the scenario, mental health providers should be advised to avoid such practices under any circumstances.",,9/27/22 23:36,10/22/22 20:25,9/27/22 23:36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798662465497,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/FTDSLJRQ/Elkins_Community Perceptions of Patient Targeted Googling.pdf,,,Ethics; Patient-targeted Googling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to recession and high unemployment, agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warn that stressors associated with a pandemic can cause increased strains, including difficulty concentrating, anxiety, and decreased mental health (CDC, 2020). Two general frameworks that explain these stressor-strain relationships over time include stress-reaction and adaptation models. Stress-reaction models suggest that stressors, such as heightened job demands due to the pandemic, accumulate over time and thus prolonged exposure to these stressors results in both immediate and long-term strain; conversely, adaptation models suggest that people adapt to stressors over time, such that strains produced by ongoing stressors tend to dissipate. After controlling for county-level COVID-19 cases, we found that (a) workers in general exhibited decreasing cognitive weariness and psychological symptoms over time, providing support for the adaptation model; (b) on-site workers experienced increasing physical fatigue over time, supporting the stress-reaction model among those workers; and (c) engaging in recovery behaviors was associated with improvements in cognitive weariness and psychological symptoms for all workers. We also found that our Time 1 outcomes were significantly different than pre-pandemic norms, such that our participants displayed lower initial levels of job-related burnout and higher initial levels of psychological symptoms than pre-pandemic norms.

While some sources of stress cannot be avoided or eliminated from certain occupations, they do not always result in stressful experiences for workers. Research is steadily uncovering the factors that influence experiences of workplace stress in hopes of better controlling its harmful outcomes. Accordingly, the present study focused on the potential impact of social comparison on workers’ interpretations of demanding workplace events and their confidence in coping with stress. A sample of 139 healthcare workers provided personal data in relation to five types of stressors common to the field of nursing, along with relevant information about how they perceive their coworkers’ responses to said stressors. Support was found for the hypothesized model through path analysis. Workers reported higher levels of stress when they were 1) frequently exposed to demanding events, and 2) when they perceived high levels of stress in their coworkers. They also felt more prepared to cope with that stress when they reported high familiarity with their coworkers’ coping tactics. However, the more stressed the workers felt, the less prepared they felt to cope overall. The insights offered by these results contribute to the fusion of stress research and social comparison literature. It is hoped that the dissemination of findings like these may inform intervention efforts to help workers manage stress while simultaneously educating them about how they can harness social information to benefit themselves and others. The timing of such efforts is particularly relevant given the COVID-19 global crisis that is exacerbating the difficulties and negative outcomes already associated with medical occupations.",2021,9/27/22 23:37,10/22/22 20:26,9/27/22 23:37,,,,,,,Modeling social comparison in the stress process,,,,,,,en_US,,,,,krex.k-state.edu,,Accepted: 2021-08-02T14:38:18Z,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/B9VCCCZZ/Chlevin_2021_Modeling social comparison in the stress process.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/DSSC2Z3T/41592.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent empirical research, however, has highlighted positive effects of nostalgia, suggesting it is a predominantly positive emotion. When measured as an individual difference, nostalgia-prone individuals report greater meaning in life and approach temperament. When manipulated in an experimental paradigm, nostalgia increases meaning in life, self-esteem, optimism, and positive affect. These positive effects may result from the specific experimental procedures used and little is known about daily experiences that covary with nostalgia. To address this gap, we aimed to measure nostalgia in ecologically valid contexts. We created and validated the Personal Inventory of Nostalgic Experiences (PINE) scale (Studies 1a–1d) to assess both trait and state-based nostalgic experiences. When measured as an individual difference, the nomological net was generally negative (Study 2). When measured in daily life (Studies 3 and 4), nostalgia as a state variable was negatively related to well-being. Lagged analyses showed that state nostalgia had mixed effects on well-being at a later moment that day and negative effects on well-being on the following day. To reconcile the discrepancies between these studies and the positive effects of nostalgia from previous research, we showed that experimentally induced nostalgic recollections were rated more positively and less negatively than daily experiences of nostalgia (Study 5). These studies show that nostalgia is a mixed emotion; although it may be predominantly positive when nostalgic memories are generated on request, it seems predominantly negative when nostalgia is experienced in the course of everyday life.

Specifically, this study investigates the mediating effects of depleted physical, cognitive, emotional, and temporal resources on the relationship between work-life conflict and the health-related behaviors of diet and physical activity. Using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk), a two-time multi-wave sample of 346 participants was collected using a 30 day time lag. The present findings provide partial support for the mediating role of energy-related resources in the relationship between WLC and dietary choices and exercise frequency.",3/22/19,9/27/22 23:37,10/22/22 17:52,9/27/22 23:37,,,,,,,Mechanisms Underlying the Relationship between Work-Life Conflict and Health Behaviors,,,,,,,en,,,,,etd.auburn.edu,,Accepted: 2019-03-22T20:26:09Z,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/S4YC8DZH/Shifrin_2019_Mechanisms Underlying the Relationship between Work-Life Conflict and Health.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/QJCUKS9N/6574.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, confrontations can also result in negative reactions from the confronted such as hostility or withdrawal. Across three studies (one experiment focused on anti-Black racism and two survey studies in which retrospective incidents of any type of racism were collected), we examine the extent to which the focus of a confrontation is associated with immediate constructive (i.e., prosocial) or destructive (i.e., antisocial, withdrawal/avoidant) responses. Specifically, we examine the differential effects of confronting racism in a way that focuses on the specific, temporary, and external behaviors enacted by the individual (behavior-focused) compared to focusing on the global, stable, and internal attributes of the person (person-focused). Across three studies we find converging evidence that behavior-focused confrontations are associated with more prosocial responses (e.g., self-improvement plans, appreciation) and that person-focused confrontations are associated with more antisocial and withdrawal/avoidant responses (e.g., hostility, avoidance). In Study 3, we find that interpersonal motivations (i.e., benevolence, revenge) and relationship repair efficacy help explain the effects of confrontation focus. We also find that the race of the confronter was not a significant moderator of findings, but we see some differences when comparing confronting anti-Black racism to confronting other types of racism (Studies 2 and 3). These results suggest that confrontation focus, and associated interpersonal motivations and beliefs, are important to understanding responses to prejudice confrontations.

The appropriateness of composites, however, is a matter of contention: some researchers have argued that composites provide an effective means of assessing general job satisfaction (e.g., Spector, American Journal of Community Psychology, 13, 693-713. 1985), whereas others have argued that composites are inappropriate and should be replaced with global job satisfaction scales (e.g., Ironson et al., Journal of Applied Psychology, 74, 193-200. 1989). To address this debate, we compared the construct validities of composite job satisfaction scales with those of global job satisfaction scales. We first created a nomological network that specifies a hypothetical pattern of relationships that exists between general job satisfaction and several external variables. Using this network as a guide, we conducted two studies (total N = 676) that examined the construct validities of four global scales and five composite scales. Within both studies, we found that composite satisfaction scales and global satisfaction scales generally yielded similar relationships with the external variables included in the nomological network. This suggests that the two types of scales are equally effective at assessing general job satisfaction. Researchers, therefore, should not summarily disregard previous studies that have used composite measures. These findings also suggest that it is appropriate to use composite measures in instances where global satisfaction data are unavailable, a situation that can occur when working with archival or organizational datasets.",2/1/22,9/27/22 23:53,9/27/22 23:53,9/27/22 23:53,91-105,,1,37,,J Bus Psychol,Measuring General Job Satisfaction,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/VFX4WVL8/Bowling_Zelazny_2022_Measuring General Job Satisfaction.pdf,,,Construct validity; Facet satisfaction; Job attitudes; Job satisfaction; Measurement; Nomological network,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this article is to use leader–member exchange (LMX) as a framework to examine how employees who report to two leaders experience WFC. Design/methodology/approach A sample of 111 engineers and researchers nested within 33 branches and 21 project teams completed an online questionnaire containing measures of LMX and WFC. Hierarchical multiple regressions were used to test the study’s hypotheses. Findings LMX with one's immediate supervisor (branch manager, LMX–BM) and project manager ( LMX–PM) each contributed unique variance in predicting WFC. LMX–PM moderated the negative relationship between LMX–BM and WFC, such that the negative relationship was stronger in magnitude at higher levels of LMX–PM quality. Research limitations/implications While most research studies have focused upon the impact of a single leader, modern organizations often involve dual reporting. Thus, results expand the extant literature to be more applicable to modern organizational realities. Findings provide evidence that future longitudinal research is worthwhile. Practical implications Results indicate that LMX theory is relevant beyond one's immediate supervisor. As a result, all managers should communicate with one another to seek better alignment. Particularly in a matrix organization where positional power is limited, leaders stand to reap the many benefits of high LMX relationships.

While numerous approaches to improving SaQ response quality have been investigated including validity checks, interactive design, and instructional manipulation checks, these are primarily targeted at situations where expected responses are of a factual nature or stated preferences. These interventions have not been evaluated in scenarios that require higher levels of engagement and judgment from respondents. While professional marketers are guided by codes of conduct, there is no equivalent code of conduct for SaQ respondents. This is particularly salient for SaQ that require higher levels of reflection and judgment, since in the absence of professional guidance, respondents rely more on their individual ethical ideologies and experience, leaving SaQ responses potentially devoid of the standards that normally set the expectations around data quality for marketing professionals. As marketing professionals are unable to provide guidance directly in a SaQ context, the approach used in this study is to offer varying levels of professional marketing guidance indirectly through specific codes of conduct reminders that are easily consumable by SaQ participants. We demonstrate that reminders and ethical ideologies moderate the relationship between the participant?s experience with SaQ and compliance with a code of conduct. Specifically, SaQ respondents produce fewer code of conduct infractions when receiving reminders than the control group, and this improves even more when the reminders coincide with the SaQ task.

Visual displays can facilitate risk communication and promote better health choices. Their effectiveness in improving risk comprehension is influenced by graph literacy. However, the construct of graph literacy is still insufficiently understood, partially because existing objective measures of graph literacy are either too difficult or too long. Objectives. We constructed a new 4-item Short Graph Literacy (SGL) scale and examined how SGL scores relate to key cognitive, affective, and conative precursors of health behavior change described in common health behavior theories. Methods. We performed secondary analyses to adapt the SGL scale from an existing 13-item scale. The initial construction was based on data collected in a laboratory setting in Germany (n = 51). The scale was then validated using data from nationally representative samples in Germany (n = 495) and the United States (n = 492). To examine how SGL scores relate to precursors of health behavior change, we performed secondary analyses of a third study involving a nationwide US sample with 47% participants belonging to racial/ethnic minorities and 46% with limited formal education (n = 835). Results. Graph literacy was significantly associated with cognitive precursors in theoretically expected ways (e.g., positive associations with risk comprehension and response efficacy and a negative association with cognitive risk perception). Patterns for affective precursors generally mirrored those for cognitive precursors, although numeracy was a stronger predictor than graph literacy for some affective factors (e.g., feelings of risk). Graph literacy had predictive value for most cognitive and affective precursors beyond numeracy. In addition, graph literacy (but not numeracy) predicted key conative precursors such as defensive processing. Conclusions. Our data suggest that the SGL scale is a fast and psychometrically valid method for measuring objective graph literacy. Our findings also highlight the theoretical and practical relevance of graph literacy.",4/1/19,9/27/22 23:54,10/6/22 18:51,9/27/22 23:54,183-195,,3,39,,Med Decis Making,,,,,,,,en,,,,,SAGE Journals,,Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc STM,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/5564APZP/Okan et al_2019_Using the Short Graph Literacy Scale to Predict Precursors of Health Behavior.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Supervisor incongruence resulted in the opposite effect. These findings suggest supervisor genuineness is vital to employee performance because of the dissonance associated with the pluralistic goal orientation in family firms.",3/1/19,9/27/22 23:54,10/6/22 19:00,9/27/22 23:54,302-321,,2,43,,,Congruence in Exchange,,,,,,,en,,,,,SAGE Journals,,Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/FCAC68EV/McLarty et al_2019_Congruence in Exchange.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, a classic brainstorming task is gamified with a leaderboard in order to explore this. Participants were randomly assigned to four classic levels of goal-setting (do-your-best, easy, difficult and impossible goals) plus a leaderboard populated with initials and scores representing identical goal-setting conditions. The presence of a leaderboard was successful in motivating participants to performance levels similar to that of difficult and impossible goal-setting, suggesting participants implicitly set goals at or near the top of the leaderboard without any prompting to do so. Goal commitment, a common individual difference moderator in goal-setting theory, was also assessed and behaved similarly in the presence of the leaderboard as when traditional goals were provided. From these results, we conclude that goal-setting theory is valuable to understand the success of leaderboards, and we recommend further exploration of existing psychological theories, including goal-setting, to better explain the effects of gamification.",6/1/17,9/27/22 23:54,9/27/22 23:54,9/27/22 23:54,508-515,,,71,,Computers in Human Behavior,Gamification of task performance with leaderboards,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/IEH7IHUC/Landers et al_2017_Gamification of task performance with leaderboards.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/RA8I9NJ5/S0747563215300868.html,,,Experiment; Gamification; Goal-setting theory; Goals; Leaderboard; Quantitative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, participants’ engagement declines while completing a survey resulting in participants tend to apply satisficing behavior (e.g., speeding, straight-lining) in order to complete the questionnaire or even break-off the completion of the questionnaire. Due to satisficing behavior, researchers are faced with the challenge of low data quality. Addressing this challenge, survey gamification promises to make web survey participation enjoyable, which might also engage participants to complete questionnaires by providing high-quality data. However, the research on the effects of gamifying web surveys (in particular on behavioral outcomes) is still inconclusive. Addressing this short-coming, we propose to examine the effects of two common game design elements – badges and a meaningful story – in an experimental study. Based on the theoretical background of gamification and the theory of cognitive absorption, we derive hypotheses and outline in detail our experimental design in this research-in-progress paper.

These changes in communication (e.g., e-mail and shared collaborative documents) present unique opportunities for workers to engage in impression management (IM) that have not been extensively explored yet. I propose that talking about busyness (TAB) and workplace telepressure are related to IM in the modern workplace. The present study examined workplace impression management within the context of virtuality and gender. A convenience sample of 294 workers completed the survey. The sample was 53% female, and most had a Bachelor’s (35%) or graduate degree (33.7%). Multiple regression (including controls for gender and age) indicated that PSC was a significant predictor of TAB, suggesting that participants who reported higher PSC also reported talking about their busyness more. Workplace telepressure was also a significant predictor of TAB, implying that those who experienced more telepressure also talked about their busyness more. Women reported experiencing telepressure and talking about busyness more than men, indicating that there are significant gender differences in both TAB and telepressure. These findings suggest that individual characteristics such as PSC and workplace telepressure are positively related to self-reported talking about one’s busyness, which lends some support to the idea that TAB, PSC, and workplace telepressure constructs are related to impression management at work. These findings represent an early contribution to our understanding of the complex dynamics of gender, impression management, and wellbeing in the workplace.",2020,9/27/22 23:55,10/22/22 19:48,9/27/22 23:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798516067242,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/EU2GXIEA/Stewart_2020_Exploration of Impression Management in the Context of Virtuality and Gender.pdf,,,Identity; Public selfconsciousness; Talking about busyness; Telepressure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Applicant reactions theory indicates that time-length judgments of a selection procedure can affect applicant perceptions. It was thus hypothesized that game-framing, the act of labeling something a game without changing the content, would cause participants to perceive that time was moving faster while completing a battery of cognitive ability tests. Similarly, it was expected that game-framing would increase test motivation and decrease test anxiety. Perceived length was tested as a mediator for the effects of game-framing on test anxiety and on test motivation. Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the hypothesized relationships. In the observed dataset, game-framing caused decreases in perceived length, perceived length was positively related to test motivation, and perceived length mediated the relationship between game-framing and test motivation. The results of this study demonstrate that game-framing affects time perceptions. This finding has implications for gamification researchers, namely, that game-framing effects should be measured and accounted for in future studies. Furthermore, applicant reactions theorists have suggested that perceived time length is a key variable in the overall applicant reactions model, and this study is the first to empirically investigate perceived time length of a selection procedure in this context.

The present study is about the unintended consequences of using such scales, because typically, not all respondents answer positively and negatively worded items consistently. This population heterogeneity—meaning that there are distinct groups of consistently and inconsistently answering respondents—may arguably underlie wording-related effects in mixed-worded scales. We formulated a constrained factor mixture analysis model that operationalized these two assumed classes of respondents. We investigated five data sets that contained four mixed-worded attitude scales, large-scale samples from three countries (Germany, Australia, and the U.S.), and two age groups (children and adolescents). The constrained factor mixture analysis model showed estimated parameter patterns in line with theoretical expectations and consistently outperformed its more traditional competitor, confirmatory factor analysis with one global and one orthogonal method factor across all used data sets. We found proportions of between 7% and 20% of respondents belonging to the inconsistent classes. To further substantiate and validate the interpretation of the proposed model, we related class membership to theoretically relevant respondent characteristics such as reading achievement, cognitive skills, or conscientiousness. Further, we undertook an initial exploration of the overlap in inconsistent respondents’ class membership across time and across scales within a survey. The article discusses implications for future research as well as for the use of mixed-worded scales.

In the present article, we consider the problem where neither requirement is available, for an inventory that has the same number of Likert-type categories for all items. We propose a bot detection algorithm that is both model-agnostic and unsupervised. Our proposed algorithm involves a permutation test with leave-one-out calculations of outlier statistics. For each respondent, it outputs a p-value for the null hypothesis that the respondent is a bot. Such an algorithm offers nominal sensitivity calibration that is robust to the bot response distribution.

The result showed that there was an influence of organizational climate on innovative behavior in the workplace by 12.1%, R2 = .121; F(1, 122) = 16,721, p < .05.The results also showed from the three dimensions of organizational climate, only two has significant effects, they are flexibility & innovation, t(120) = 2.433, p < .05, and outward focus, t(120) = 2.113, p < .05. Dimension which not significantly affect innovation work behaviour is reflexivity, t(120) = -.143, p = .886. The implications of this study can be considered by organizations to develop a supportive organizational climate so that employees feel comfortable to display innovative work behaviors and at the end will ultimately have a positive impact for the organization.",8/28/21,9/28/22 0:04,9/28/22 0:04,9/28/22 0:04,22-34,,1,20,,Jurnal Psikologi,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/P6IZY7SE/Etikariena and Kalimashada - 2021 - The Influence of Organizational Climate on Innovat.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Taking such a dynamic perspective on leader behaviors, we examined daily servant leadership behavior and its downstream effects on the leaders themselves from a within-person self-regulation perspective. Results from two experience sampling studies consistently revealed that engaging in daily servant leadership behavior can come at a cost for the leaders. Specifically, for leaders who are low in perspective taking, engaging in servant leadership behavior was associated with increases in same-day depletion and next-day withdrawal from their leadership role (i.e., greater laissez-faire behavior). However, for leaders who frequently exercise perspective taking, engaging in daily servant leadership behavior was instead associated with decreases in depletion and subsequent laissez-faire behavior, suggesting that servant leadership behaviors are replenishing for these individuals. Experience in perspective taking is therefore a key individual difference that determines whether enacting servant leadership behavior is beneficial or detrimental for leaders.

Exchanges, satisfaction, and repurchases are potential customer relationship management outcomes that may contribute to customer lifetime value. We empirically examine these outcomes with respect to two store labor factors: salesperson competence and selling pressure. Using transactional data and 7921 customer satisfaction survey responses obtained from a jewelry retailer, we demonstrate an in-store return experience may contribute to customer lifetime value more through future purchases than through immediate exchanges. We show convincing customers to exchange their returns may decrease their future purchases if customers are dissatisfied with their return experience. Our results suggest, in order to increase both exchanges and future purchases, retailers should improve the competence of employees who handle returns and abstain from using selling pressure during a return experience.

Reactions were theorized to depend on 3rd parties’ beliefs about the targeted coworker and, specifically, whether the target of abuse was considered deserving of mistreatment. We predicted that 3rd parties would experience anger when targets of abuse were considered undeserving of mistreatment; angered 3rd parties would then be motivated to harm the abusive supervisor and support the targeted coworker. Conversely, we predicted that 3rd parties would experience contentment when targets of abuse were considered deserving of mistreatment; contented 3rd parties would then be motivated to exclude the targeted coworker. Additionally, we predicted that 3rd parties’ moral identity would moderate the effects of 3rd parties’ experienced emotions on their behavioral reactions, such that a strong moral identity would strengthen ethical behavior (i.e., coworker support) and weaken harmful behavior (i.e., supervisor-directed deviance, coworker exclusion).

As evidence of the adverse correlates of cyber aggression mounts, improved understanding of the mechanisms that facilitate electronic aggression is needed. Moral disengagement (i.e., cognitive processes through which individuals disengage from their moral values) has been shown to predict cyber aggression when assessed as a unitary construct. The present study investigated the eight moral disengagement mechanisms measured by the Moral Disengagement Measure (Detert et al., 2008) and their relationships to four types of cyber aggression perpetration assessed with the Cyberbullying Experiences Survey (i.e., malice, public humiliation, deception, and unwanted contact; Doane et al., 2013). Emerging adults (N = 404, 58.67% women) aged 18 to 29 (M = 25.16, SD = 2.76) recruited through Amazon.com’s MTurk website completed measures online, and data were analyzed via path analysis. Each type of cyber aggression perpetration was predicted by different moral disengagement mechanisms. Advantageous comparison and dehumanization were the strongest predictors, and dehumanization was the only mechanism to predict all forms of cyber aggression. These findings provide support for the role of these mechanisms in cyber aggression and suggest that examining moral disengagement mechanisms individually may help to improve our understanding of cyber aggression among emerging adults.

In particular, we argue that poor-performing subordinates instill in supervisors a sense of hostility toward the subordinate, which in turn leads to engaging in abusive supervision. Within this self-control framework, poor performance is more likely to lead to abusive supervision when (a) the magnitude of the hostility experienced is higher (e.g., for those with a hostile attribution bias), or (b) the translation of hostility into abusive supervision is unconstrained (e.g., for those who are low in trait mindfulness). In two experimental studies with full-time supervisors where we manipulated the independent variable (Study 1) and the mediator (Study 2), and in a multi-wave and multi-source field study with data collected from supervisor–subordinate teams (50 supervisors and 206 subordinates) at two time points (Study 3), we found overall support for our predictions.

Though electronic multitasking is common and potentially harmful to meeting effectiveness because it distracts individuals from achieving meeting goals, research in the organizational sciences is limited and largely atheoretical. Thus, the current study leverages the counterproductive work behavior framework to better understand why employees engage in electronic multitasking and also its relationship with individual/group meeting productivity. Data were collected from 406 working adults in a series of two surveys asking them about a recurring staff meeting they attend. Results suggest that there are both individual (i.e. conscientiousness) and meeting-oriented (i.e. meeting medium, norms for multitasking, and meeting size) predictors of electronic multitasking. Additionally, employee workload moderates several of these relationships; for example, highly committed employees/employees who perceive high levels of organizational justice were actually more likely to engage in electronic multitasking, which could suggest that they are electronically multitasking for worthy reasons (i.e. coping with their workload). However, the results also suggest a negative relationship between electronic multitasking and perceived individual/group meeting productivity, which points to the fact that this behavior is nuanced.

Additionally, we investigate morning aversive tasks as an antecedent of increased depletion and decreased self-control motivation. Further, we examine the role of self-regulation strategies (organizing, meaning-related strategies, and self-reward) for maintaining and improving performance when depleted or low in self-control motivation. Data from a 2-week diary study with three daily measurements (N = 135 employees; n = 991 days) were analyzed. Multilevel path modeling showed that self-control motivation at the beginning of work and depletion at midday predicted afternoon task performance. We found that self-reward in the afternoon counteracts the negative relationship between depletion and task performance. Further, we found an indirect effect from morning aversive tasks on task performance via depletion at noon buffered by afternoon self-reward. Organizing and meaning in the afternoon were positively related to afternoon task performance.

Method: The current study aimed to examine these relationships among 2,707 undergraduate students (70% female, Mage = 20.60, 29.95% with nonsuicidal self-injury history) who completed online self-report questionnaires. Analyses utilized structural equation modeling trees and structural equation modeling forests to identify potential subgroups based on nonsuicidal self-injury frequency and/or methods in relation to indicators of clinical severity. Results: Results revealed splits in the following: (a) frequency (between 0 and 1 act); (b) among those with ≥1 acts, frequency (between 8 and 9 acts); (c) among those with ≥1 acts, number of methods (between 1 and 2 methods); and (d) among those with ≥9 acts and ≥2 methods, frequency (between 15 and 16 acts).

PM3PTDFC,journalArticle,,"Carlsen, Josh J.",An investigation of work engagement as a moderator of the relationship between personality and work outcomes,Master's Theses,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1682044741/abstract/1A21A8D3AEDB48AAPQ/1,"Previous research has shown that personality dimensions predict work outcomes such as organizational citizenship behaviors (extra-role behaviors not related to formal job requirements that have been shown to predict job performance) and organizational commitment (a psychological state linking an employee’s relationship with the organization and is predictive of retention and emotional attachment towards the organization). For example, the personality traits of Conscientiousness and Extraversion have both been shown to be robust predictors of job performance and as partially contributing to both organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB) and organizational commitment (OC). In addition, a limited amount of research has investigated how work engagement (a psychological state of mind characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption in one’s work) can impact personality and its relationships with OCBs and OC. The current study utilized work engagement as a moderator between personality characteristics (Conscientiousness, Extraversion) and both OCBs and OC. The present study’s sample included 204 respondents from the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) service who completed an online survey. Respondents were required to be employed at least part-time (20 or more hours per week), 18 years of age or older, and live in the United States. The results indicated that engagement significantly moderated the relationship between Conscientiousness and affective commitment, such that the positive relationship between Conscientiousness and affective commitment was significantly stronger for those high in engagement compared to those low in engagement. However, engagement was not found to significantly moderate any other relationships hypothesized in the study. The present study extends the application of engagement and how it can moderate the relationship between personality and the work outcomes of OCB and OC. The findings suggest that engagement may help increase levels of the work-related outcomes of OCB and OC depending on the individual’s personality traits. Future research could explore how engagement may moderate the relationship between personality and other work-related constructs, such as job satisfaction. Finally, personnel departments, company executives, and managers should all ensure their organizational processes and culture are supportive of measuring and maximizing engagement in their employees, as engagement can significantly impact employee well being, productivity, and overall organizational effectiveness.",,9/28/22 0:06,10/22/22 20:31,9/28/22 0:06,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9781321728934,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/X2BY73U4/Carlsen_An investigation of work engagement as a moderator of the relationship between.pdf,,,Psychology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we present a dynamic framework of boundary permeability that aims to answer this question. We propose that daily events are associated with increases in permeation across daily work and nonwork boundaries, and that these increases are strongest on the days when the events occur. We further argue that support seeking and social capitalization are critical interpersonal processes that provide additional insights into the relations between daily events and daily boundary permeation. In Study 1, working parents (N = 88) completed a paper diary for seven days (612 observations), with repeated measures of daily events (hassles and uplifts) and daily work and nonwork boundary permeation. In Study 2, employed individuals (N = 138) completed a similar diary on-line (834 observations) that also included measures of the interpersonal processes. Results of both studies were generally consistent with our hypotheses, and offered support for our dynamic framework. At a practical level, our findings reinforce the importance of incorporating flexibility into human resources practices that are meant to support employees’ efforts to manage the work-nonwork interface – because every day brings about new events.",6/23/22,9/28/22 0:06,9/28/22 0:06,9/28/22 0:06,24-Jan,,0,0,,,A dynamic framework of boundary permeability,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1359432X.2022.2081075,,,,,boundary permeability; daily events; role transitions; social capitalization; social support; Work-nonwork interface,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Instructors (Study 1; N = 125, 64.2% graduate students) who were more sensitive to traditional disruptions (e.g., arriving late) were more sensitive to technology-related disruptions (e.g., texting). Attitudes toward personal devices in relation to learning were negatively associated with perceived disruptiveness. Policies to restrict devices were related to perceived frequency, but not disruptiveness, of technology-related disruptions. Students (Study 2; N = 174) reported that classroom disruptions from personal devices were infrequent and considered it more important for instructors to set policies for traditional disruptions than for use of personal devices. In Study 3, students (N = 187) reported attitudes about academic use of personal devices at the beginning of an introductory course and distraction from devices at the end of the course. Distractibility was associated with lower quiz scores but was unrelated to attitudes about devices. Nontraditional students (≥24 years) reported less media multitasking and had higher quiz scores than traditional students but did not differ in attitudes about devices. Given their divergent views, instructors and students should communicate more about the potential for personal devices to disrupt the learning process.

Although a link has been established between several ER strategies and PTSD symptoms, a number of critical issues have yet to be fully addressed in this literature. These involve key questions such as what factor structure underlies ER strategy use, which strategies are most predictive of PTSD symptoms, which PTSD symptom clusters are best predicted by ER strategies, and what the function is of negative affect in the ER-PTSD association. The purpose of the current study was to examine the associations between several ER strategies and PTSD symptom clusters among independent undergraduate and community samples while controlling for negative affect. For ER strategy use, a measurement model treating each strategy as a distinct latent variable best fit the data in both samples. For PTSD symptoms, the seven-factor Hybrid model best fit the data in both samples. In both samples, ER strategies reflecting a pervasive unwillingness to experience unpleasant thoughts and emotions (i.e., experiential avoidance, thought suppression, self-medication) best predicted PTSD symptoms even after controlling for negative affect. A number of implications for the ER-PTSD association and directions for future research are discussed.",5/6/16,9/28/22 0:06,10/22/22 17:39,9/28/22 0:06,,,,,,,Emotion Regulation Strategy Use,,,,,,,en,EMBARGO_NOT_AUBURN,,,,etd.auburn.edu,,Accepted: 2016-05-06T14:29:18Z,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/CGWYSDNQ/Lee_2016_Emotion Regulation Strategy Use.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/I6B2NAMT/5188.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study contributes to resolving the ongoing debate on whether SJTs are situational measures, by incorporating findings on person × situation interactions into SJT research. Specifically, across three studies (NTotal = 1,239), we first tested whether situation construal (i.e., the individual perception of situations in SJTs) predicts responses to SJT items. Second, we assessed whether the relevance of situation construal for SJT performance depends on test elements (i.e., situation descriptions and response options) and item features (i.e., description-dependent vs. description-independent SJT items). Lastly, we determined whether situation construal has incremental validity for job-related criteria over and above SJT performance. The results showed that, for most SJT items, situation construal significantly contributed to SJT performance, even if only response options were available. This was also true for SJT items that are significantly more difficult to solve when situation descriptions are omitted (i.e., description-dependent SJT items). Finally, situation construal explained variance in relevant criteria over and above SJT performance. Despite recent efforts to reconceptualize SJTs, our results suggest that they can still be viewed as situational measures. However, situation descriptions may be less crucial for these underlying situational processes.

Assessment of these issues via Web-based surveys is growing continuously. Research has suggested that approximately one-fifth of respondents submit cribbed answers, or cheat, on factual knowledge items, which may lead to measurement error. However, little is known about methods of discouraging cheating in Web-based surveys on health knowledge. Objective: This study aimed at exploring the usefulness of imposing a survey time limit to prevent help-seeking and cheating. Methods: On the basis of sample size estimation, 94 undergraduate students were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to complete a Web-based survey on nutrition knowledge, with or without a time limit of 15 minutes (30 seconds per item); the topic of nutrition was chosen because of its particular relevance to public health. The questionnaire consisted of two parts. The first was the validated consumer-oriented nutrition knowledge scale (CoNKS) consisting of 20 true/false items; the second was an ad hoc questionnaire (AHQ) containing 10 questions that would be very difficult for people without health care qualifications to answer correctly. It therefore aimed at measuring cribbing and not nutrition knowledge. AHQ items were somewhat encyclopedic and amenable to Web searching, while CoNKS items had more complex wording, so that simple copying/pasting of a question in a search string would not produce an immediate correct answer. Results: A total of 72 of the 94 subjects started the survey. Dropout rates were similar in both groups (11%, 4/35 and 14%, 5/37 in the untimed and timed groups, respectively). Most participants completed the survey from portable devices, such as mobile phones and tablets. To complete the survey, participants in the untimed group took a median 2.3 minutes longer than those in the timed group; the effect size was small (Cohen&#8217;s r=.29). Subjects in the untimed group scored significantly higher on CoNKS (mean difference of 1.2 points, P=.008) and the effect size was medium (Cohen&#8217;s d=0.67). By contrast, no significant between-group difference in AHQ scores was documented. Unexpectedly high AHQ scores were recorded in 23% (7/31) and 19% (6/32) untimed and timed respondents, respectively, very probably owing to &#8220;e-cheating&#8221;. Conclusions: Cribbing answers to health knowledge items in researcher-uncontrolled conditions is likely to lead to overestimation of people&#8217;s knowledge; this should be considered during the design and implementation of Web-based surveys. Setting a time limit alone may not completely prevent cheating, as some cheats may be very fast in Web searching. More complex and contextualized wording of items and checking for the &#8220;findability&#8221; properties of items before implementing a Web-based health knowledge survey may discourage help-seeking, thus reducing measurement error. Studies with larger sample sizes and diverse populations are needed to confirm our results.",4/13/15,9/28/22 0:07,9/28/22 0:07,9/28/22 0:07,e3734,,4,17,,,Uncontrolled Web-Based Administration of Surveys on Factual Health-Related Knowledge,,,,,,,EN,,,,,www.jmir.org,,"Company: Journal of Medical Internet Research Distributor: Journal of Medical Internet Research Institution: Journal of Medical Internet Research Label: Journal of Medical Internet Research Publisher: JMIR Publications Inc., Toronto, Canada",,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/E5BDK9EY/e94.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These busyness expressions and the perceptions surrounding them have received some empirical attention but have not been studied in depth. My thesis takes an inductive, exploratory approach, laying groundwork for what we can learn by studying busyness expressions. I developed the Busyness Expression Interpretation Scale (BEIS) to understand how employees interpret the busyness expressions of those around them. Recruitment via social networking sites, such as Facebook and Linkedin yielded 293 responses that were retained for data analysis. Participants completed a survey distributed via Qualtrics. The survey included the BEIS, as well as measures of public self-consciousness, impression management, work values, job insecurity, subjective job stress, burnout, employee engagement, and job satisfaction. A series of exploratory factor analyses assessed the factor structure of the BEIS, resulting in the removal of five items and partially supporting a three-factor structure of the BEIS, assessing achievement, social, and security interpretation tendencies. Confirmatory factor analysis established the discriminant validity of the BEIS from conceptually related constructs (public self-consciousness, impression management, and work values). Correlations demonstrated significant positive relationships between the BEIS and subjective job stress and burnout, as well as some significant negative relationships between the BEIS and job satisfaction and employee engagement. Participants’ reported frequency of busyness expressions from coworkers and supervisors also demonstrated significant relationships with stress and burnout. Hierarchical regressions demonstrated that the BEIS explains incremental variance over simple frequency in predicting job stress and burnout. The results of these analyses shed light on how busyness expressions in the workplace relate to employees’ well-being. Those who are exposed more to others using busyness expressions may experience more severe stress burnout. How employees interpret busyness expressions provide further insight into how busyness expressions can influence well-being in the form of stress, job satisfaction, engagement, and burnout. Furthermore, the BEIS itself offers an avenue for understanding how busyness expressions operate. Its three- factor structure shows promise but needs to be developed further.",2020,9/28/22 0:07,10/22/22 19:55,9/28/22 0:07,,,,,,,Why So Busy?,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798738625268,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/I2DN58MJ/Woodward_2020_Why So Busy.pdf,,,Busy; Busyness; Coworkers; Expressions; Measure assessing interpretations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 4 studies, we propose and test a different way of thinking about the performance-promotion relationship. Prospect theory, spiraling theory, and sponsored and contest mobility were used to support the notion that change in performance is at least as important to the prediction of promotion decisions as is absolute level of performance. In Study 1, performance and promotion data were collected for 563 white-collar employees at each of 4 time points spread over 6 years. As hypothesized, change in job performance significantly predicted change in workers’ hierarchical level (i.e., promotion) beyond previous performance level. In Study 2, we found that upward trends are associated with ratings of future performance expectation and promotability through their effects on attributions of conscientiousness, proactive personality, and job dedication. In Study 3, we replicated the findings of Study 2 and found no evidence of a performance trend by performance level interaction. In Study 4, we showed that those with upward trends are preferred even to those with performance that is consistent and strong. Taken together, our results suggest that the reason for the modest performance-promotion relationships found in previous research may be that performance trends are seen by decision makers as containing at least as much promotion-relevant information as do performance averages or recent performance levels.

Although BWAs are proliferating worldwide, the lack of predefined temporal and locational structures is unlikely to appeal to every employee. To investigate with whom and when BWAs cause positive reactions, we conducted two experimental vignette studies among full-time employees. In Study 1, we used a 2 (BWAs: yes vs. no) × 2 (development support: yes vs. no) between-subjects design (N = 212) and, in Study 2, a within-subjects design with the same factors (N = 114). Additionally, in both studies, we measured individual differences in autonomy orientation and personal need for structure. Study 1 showed that, relative to traditional working arrangements, BWAs enhance organizational attractiveness and intention to demonstrate organizational citizenship behaviour.

To prevent morbidity and mortality, three vaccines have been licensed and are recommended by Canada’s National Advisory Committee on Immunisation (for girls since 2007 and boys since 2012). Nevertheless, HPV vaccine coverage in Canada remains suboptimal in many regions. This study will be the first to concurrently examine the correlates of HPV vaccine decision-making in parents of school-aged girls and boys and evaluate changes in parental knowledge, attitudes and behaviours over time. Methods and analysis Using a national, online survey utilising theoretically driven constructs and validated measures, this study will identify HPV vaccine coverage rates and correlates of vaccine decision-making in Canada at two time points (August–September 2016 and June–July 2017). 4606 participants will be recruited to participate in an online survey through a market research and polling firm using email invitations. Data cleaning methods will identify inattentive or unmotivated participants. Ethics and dissemination The study received research ethics board approval from the Research Review Office, Integrated Health and Social Services University Network for West-Central Montreal (CODIM-FLP-16–219).

We design and conduct large-scale surveys and experiments in six countries to investigate how people perceive immigrants and how these perceptions inﬂuence their support for redistribution. We ﬁnd striking misperceptions about the number and characteristics of immigrants. In all countries, respondents greatly overestimate the total number of immigrants, think immigrants are culturally and religiously more distant from them, and economically weaker–less educated, more unemployed, and more reliant on and favored by government transfers–than they actually are. In the experimental part of our paper, we show that simply making respondents think about immigration before asking questions about redistribution makes them support less redistribution, including actual donations to charities. The perception that immigrants are economically weaker and more likely to take advantage of the welfare system is strongly correlated with lower support for redistribution, much more so than the perceived cultural distance or the perceived share of immigrants. These ﬁndings are conﬁrmed by further experimental evidence. Information about the true shares and origins of immigrants does not change support for redistribution. An anecdote about a “hard working” immigrant has somewhat stronger eﬀects, but is unable to counteract the negative priming eﬀect of making people think about immigration. Our results further suggest that narratives shape people’s views on immigration more deeply than hard facts.",2018-06,9/28/22 0:07,10/29/22 17:57,9/28/22 0:07,,,,,,,,Working Paper Series,,,,,,,,,,,National Bureau of Economic Research,,DOI: 10.3386/w24733,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/5T3PEI9S/Alesina et al_2018_Immigration and Redistribution.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In three studies using three methodologies (qualitative inductive, cultural consensus modeling, and experimental), we used data from 2,140 participants to reveal 26 domain general cues that can indicate whether a product or process is creative. About 95 percent of the Chinese used a broad range of cues, whereas about 75 percent of the Americans used a narrow range of cues. Members of both cultures found cues such as breakthrough, surprise, and potential to indicate creativity. In contrast, cues such as easy to use, feasible, and for a mass market were indicators of creativity for most Chinese and noncreativity for most Americans. Thus, in addition to domain knowledge, knowledge about creativity itself contributes to creativity assessments. Cross-cultural differences in knowledge about creativity can help explain differences in how members of different cultures assess creativity. These findings have implications for the scholarly conceptual definition of creativity and suggest an array of possibilities for research on creativity and innovation.",2016-12,9/28/22 0:07,9/28/22 0:07,9/28/22 0:07,320-348,,4,2,,AMD,Implicit Theories of Creative Ideas,,,,,,,,,,,,journals-aom-org.prox.lib.ncsu.edu (Atypon),,Publisher: Academy of Management,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/TSK3HY8I/Loewenstein_Mueller_2016_Implicit Theories of Creative Ideas.pdf,,,creativity; culture; implicit theories,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similar to prior work, we confirm in Study1 that points increase reaction time and error rate, and positive affect. We replicated these results in Study2, and expanded our analysis to investigate participant experience.

Drawing on social-cognitive theory and related research, we suggest abused supervisors might defy rather than emulate their managers’ abusive behavior. Specifically, we predicted that some abused supervisors—namely, those with strong moral identities—might in effect “change course” by engaging in less abuse or demonstrating ethical leadership with their subordinates to the extent they disidentify with their abusive managers. Across 2 experiments (n = 288 and 462 working adults, respectively) and a field study (n = 500 employees and their supervisors), we show that relations between manager abuse and supervisors’ abusive and ethical behaviors were carried by supervisors’ disidentification, and that the direct and indirect effects of manager abuse were stronger for supervisors with comparatively higher moral identity levels. We discuss our findings’ implications and avenues for future research.

Hidden motives and secondary gain expectations may play a significant role in clinical patients. We studied the prevalence of noncredible symptom report in patients treated for minor mental disorders in an inpatient setting.Method: Five hundred and thirty seven clinical inpatients of a psychosomatic rehabilitation center were studied (mean age: 50.2 years; native speakers of German). They were referred for treatment of depression, anxiety, somatoform disorder, adjustment disorder, and neurasthenia. Results of two symptom validity tests (Structured Inventory of Malingered Symptomatology, SIMS; Self-Report Symptom Inventory, SRSI) and the Beck Depression Inventory–II (BDI–II) were analyzed.Results: At screening level, 34.5% and 29.8% of the patients were found to presumably overreport symptoms on the SIMS and SRSI, respectively. At the standard cut score of the SRSI (maximum false positive rate: 5%), the proportion of diagnosed overreporting was 18.8%. SIMS and SRSI pseudosymptom endorsement correlated at .73. Highly elevated depressive symptom claims with BDI–II scores above 40, found in 9.3% of the patients, were associated with elevated pseudosymptom endorsement. Moreover, extended times of sick leave and higher expectations of disability pension were associated with elevated pseudosymptom endorsement.Conclusions: The prevalence of symptom overreporting in some clinical patient groups is a serious, yet underinvestigated problem.

Uncertainty regarding the origins of a pain problem may lead to pain catastrophizing and unfruitful healthcare seeking behaviors. Individuals with chronic pain often turn to the internet to identify possible causes or sources of their pain symptoms, thus affirming their pain experience. Despite evidence that pain catastrophizing amplifies distress about pain complaints, no studies have investigated whether it is associated with escalations in health anxiety that result from searching for online health information (i.e., cyberchondria). The aim of the present study was to investigate whether pain catastrophizing predicted variance in cyberchondria above and beyond health anxiety. Undergraduate students (N = 221, 70.6% female) completed questionnaires assessing pain catastrophizing, health anxiety, and cyberchondria. Results from hierarchical regression models indicated that pain catastrophizing predicted unique variance in four dimensions of cyberchondria: compulsion, distress, excessiveness, and reassurance.

The Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (TriPM) operationalizes the model through a 58-item self-report questionnaire. The current study examined the psychometric properties of the Swedish translation by investigating intercorrelations and associations to expert-rated psychopathy, general personality and psychopathy-related traits in male high-security prisoners (n = 191). Psychopathy rated with TriPM and the Psychopathy Checklist Revised (PCL-R) demonstrated expected convergence, as did empathy and impulsivity measures. The Disinhibition and Meanness scales were highly correlated, indicating that the scales might not be adequately differentiated. Nevertheless, the divergent association patterns to other important variables, particularly neuroticism and empathy, also points to meaningful differences. However, the lack of association between Disinhibition and Boldness may put into question if these domains are related at all, especially since there was a lack of similarity in the association patterns with other clinical variables. The inﬂuence of antisocial behavior in the TriPM operationalization might amplify the similarities of the Meanness and Disinhibition scales, while diluting the associations between Meanness and Boldness.

LV7V526L,journalArticle,,"Francavilla, Nicole Marie",The Influence of Virtual Leadership and Relationship Characteristic Variables on Follower Outcomes,Dissertations,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/2343503233/abstract/7ADA865DCAAE4EE7PQ/1,"Globalization and communication technology advancements have led to a rise in companies’ use of virtual or remote workers (i.e., employees who work at least part of their workweek away from a company office). Virtual work arrangements provide many benefits (e.g., diverse workforce, increased productivity, enhanced employee well-being), but also pose many challenges for virtual workers (e.g., feelings of isolation and uncertainty). Leadership has been suggested as one mechanism through which companies can optimize the experience of virtual workers, lending to a stream of research on effective virtual leadership. Virtual leadership studies tend to simplify the construct by examining only leader-follower distance or reliance on technology as its operationalizations, failing to examine the many nuances associated with working at a distance from one’s leader. The present study examines a more holistic picture of the virtual follower’s experience by investigating five leader-follower relationship characteristic variables: geographic distance, communication frequency, media richness, leader availability, and leader responsiveness. Relationships among these relationship characteristic variables and follower outcomes including job satisfaction, affective commitment, engagement, job performance, and leader effectiveness are examined to investigate the differential ways in which aspects of the leader-follower relationship dynamic influence followers’ job attitudes and performance. Finally, the interactive effects of the relationship characteristic variables combined with generally beneficial (transformational, contingent reward) and generally detrimental (destructive) leadership behaviors on follower outcomes are examined. Results generally indicate that leader-follower geographic distance and the richness of media used to communicate do not meaningfully relate to followers’ job satisfaction, affective commitment, engagement, job performance, or leader effectiveness. The extent to which a leader provides a follower attention via communication frequency, availability, and responsiveness is much more predictive of positive follower job attitudes and performance. Supplemental analyses reveal differential moderating relationships among leader behaviors (transformational, contingent reward, destructive) and relationship characteristics (communication frequency, leader availability, leader responsiveness) on the set of follower outcomes. For example, leader-follower communication frequency exacerbates the negative effects of destructive leadership on all follower outcomes, and leader attention (via availability and responsiveness) moderates the relationship between leader behavior (transformational and contingent reward) and follower self-reported job performance such that leader behavior positively relates to performance when attention is high, but negatively relates to performance when attention is low. Implications for future virtual leadership research, applications in practice, and limitations are discussed.",,9/28/22 0:19,10/22/22 17:11,9/28/22 0:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9781392622599,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/3RENNSS9/Francavilla_The Influence of Virtual Leadership and Relationship Characteristic Variables.pdf,,,Job performance; Leader-follower communication,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the current study was to examine the effects of a values intervention on participant's willingness to approach established aversive stimuli. College students (n = 200) completed questionnaires and participated in behavioral approach tasks with aversive stimuli.

AEWJB82T,journalArticle,,"Le, Rody R",Effect of Food Shape and Firm Reputation on Perceived,Master's Theses,,,,,"This study researched the main effect of food shape (normal versus abnormal) on purchase intention and examined if perceived food quality mediated the effect, and if firm reputation (low vs. high) moderated this mediated effect. This study adds to the existing knowledge in two ways. Firstly, this study clarifies the decline in consumers’ purchase intention when food shape deviates by looking into perceived food quality. Retailers could use this insight to enhance consumers’ perceived quality by informing them that abnormal shaped foods are of the same quality as normal shaped foods. Secondly, this study adds to the existing knowledge about cue utilisation theory and the dominance of intrinsic over extrinsic cues by examining if a positive extrinsic high-scope cue can counter the negative effect of an intrinsic high-scope cue. The study has been performed amongst 214 consumers and consisted out of a 2 (food shape: normal or abnormal) x 2 (firm reputation: low or high) factorial between-subjects design. The results showed that food shape influences consumers’ purchase intention: consumers are less likely to purchase abnormal shaped foods when compared to normal shaped foods. The results also showed that perceived quality partially mediates the effect of food shape on consumers’ purchase intention: when consumers are exposed to abnormal shaped foods, their quality perceptions are lower, which consequently weakens their purchase intentions. The study did not find a moderation effect of firm reputation on the mediation effect. This implies that a high firm reputation cannot eliminate the negative effect of abnormal shaped foods on perceived quality and purchase intention. Future research should measure consumers’ price perception, as research shows that high reputational firms can form higher reference price scales while consumers are less likely to purchase a product when they perceive the price as high.",,9/28/22 0:19,10/22/22 17:38,,56,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/5W3GLCFC/Le - Effect of Food Shape and Firm Reputation on Percei.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Past research has shown WFC to negatively impact an individual's work outcomes in a number of ways. For example, WFC has been shown to be negatively correlated with job satisfaction and positively correlated with job burnout. A limited amount of research has examined individual differences in how WFC relates to work outcomes, however. The current study utilized polychronicity, an individual difference variable that involves a preference for multitasking, as a moderator between WFC and work outcomes. It was theorized that those high in polychronicity (having a strong preference for engaging in multiple tasks at the same time) may be better equipped to handle a great deal of multitasking between work and family responsibilities. Thus, it was hypothesized that those high in polychronicity would experience weaker relationships between WFC and work outcomes, compared to those low in polychronicity (preferring to focus on one task at a time). The present study's sample included 341 university undergraduate students and 257 respondents from the Amazon Mechanical Turk service who all completed an online survey. Respondents were required to be employed and working at least part-time, be at least 18 years of age and live in the United States. The results indicated that polychronicity significantly moderated the relationship between WFC and job satisfaction, such that the negative correlation between WFC and job satisfaction was significantly weaker at high levels of polychronicity compared to low levels of polychronicity. Also, polychronicity was found to significantly moderate the relationship between WFC and employee engagement. The nature of this interaction was such that WFC had a positive relationship with employee engagement among those high in polychronicity and a negative relationship among those low in polychronicity. The present study extends the application of polychronicity to the area of WFC, as no research had previously done. The findings suggest that a preference for multitasking may help mitigate the negative work-related outcomes that can commonly be experienced when an individual is faced with high amounts of WFC. Future research could explore how polychronicity may moderate the relationship between WFC and other work-related constructs, such as job performance or turnover intentions.",,9/28/22 0:19,10/22/22 17:09,9/28/22 0:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9781303891120,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/GM4VCUSR/Aasen_How polychronicity moderates relationships between work-family conflict and.pdf,,,Psychology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this quantitative correlational study was to examine the relationship between IP, EI, and LE in a Hispanic university student population. The theoretical basis for this study was grounded in the social identity theory (SIT) and self-categorization theory (SCT). According to the SIT and SCT, individuals can develop 2 principle identities: a personal self and a collective self. A descriptive between-subjects design was used to compare 3 independent samples of 90 Hispanic college students recruited from a Hispanic serving institution (HSI), a primarily White learning institution (PWI), and an online learning (OL) institution. Participants completed the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS), the Social and Personal Identities Scale (SIPI), and a demographic survey. A 3-step hierarchical multiple regression analysis revealed that LE and IP were unrelated at all levels of EI.

Previous research has shown that social isolation can contribute to psychological distress. The impact of increased social isolation on mental health functioning during the COVID-19 crisis, as well as potential mechanisms to buffer this impact, have yet to be investigated. The current study explored the moderating role of psychological flexibility and related constructs on the relationships between social isolation and mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional data from 278 participants, the majority residing in the United States, were collected during a 3-week period from mid-April to early May 2020 via online survey. A series of hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated statistically significant relationships between social isolation and psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and stress), well-being, and valued living. Psychological inflexibility, intolerance of uncertainty, and emotional suppression significantly moderated these relationships in a number of instances. Greater psychological flexibility and acceptance of difficult experiences appeared to act as a buffer against the negative effects of increased social isolation, while amplifying the benefits of social connectedness. Implications for promoting mental health and buffering against the harmful effects of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond are discussed.",10/1/20,9/28/22 0:19,9/28/22 0:19,9/28/22 0:19,162-174,,,18,,Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/8QYPWQVY/S2212144720301903.html; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/QHM7YMZF/Smith et al_2020_Psychological inflexibility and intolerance of uncertainty moderate the.pdf,,,COVID-19; Emotion suppression; Intolerance of uncertainty; Moderation; Psychological flexibility; Social isolation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple theories in vocational psychology undergird an understanding of P-V fit, including the circular model of vocational interests and social cognitive career theory (SCCT). However, it is unclear whether predictions based upon these theories are generalizable across a range of societies. To help overcome this limitation, we conduct what is to our knowledge the broadest international study of vocational interests to date. Based upon Hofstede's (2003) cross-cultural theory and Inglehart and Baker's (2000) modernization theory, we hypothesize that both the circular model and a key proposition based on SCCT, namely a positive relationship between educational attainment and P-V fit, will be less appreciable in societies low on cultural individualism and economic development. Using 81,445 responses from 74 countries to an online vocational inventory, we found partial support for these hypotheses. Our findings underscore the need for additional research to understand the relevance of the circular model and SCCT to societies that differ culturally and economically from settings like the United States where those theories have been predominately developed and tested. Our findings also warrant caution for practitioners in employing recommendations and interventions based upon these theories in such societies without thoroughly validating their use.",6/1/19,9/28/22 0:19,10/21/22 2:30,9/28/22 0:19,92-108,,,112,,Journal of Vocational Behavior,Person-vocation fit across the world of work,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/WGDFS9LW/Glosenberg et al_2019_Person-vocation fit across the world of work.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/V3NDNXTA/S0001879119300028.html,,,Circular model; Economic development; Individualism; Person-vocation fit; Social and cognitive career theory; Vocational interests,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have addressed this issue by developing the verbal CRT (CRT-V), a novel 10-item measure of cognitive reflection (https://osf.io/xehbv/), using nonmathematical problems with good statistical and psychometric properties and with low familiarity. First, we selected suitable items with relatively low familiarity and optimal difficulty as identified in two different populations (Studies 1 and 2) and with high content validity as judged by an expert panel (Study 3). Second, we demonstrated good criterion and construct validity for the test in different populations with a wide range of variables (Studies 4–6, 8) and a good internal consistency (Studies 4–8) and test–retest reliability (Study 7). The CRT-V was less associated with math anxiety, objective and subjective numeracy than the original CRT, and it was test equivalent across gender, age groups and administration setting. In contrast with the original CRT (Hedge's g = 0.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.17, 0.40]), the CRT-V showed no gender differences (Hedge's g = −0.06, 95% CI [−0.18, 0.06]).

In the present experiments (total N = 2,145), the causal link between thwarted goals and endorsement of violent means (guns and war) was found to be contingent on perceptions that violence is normatively valued. Experiments 1–3 establish that thwarted goals increase endorsement of violence primarily among U.S. adults of a lower educational background and/or men who endorse a masculine honor culture. Experiment 4 manipulates the perceived normative consensus of college educated Americans, and demonstrates that thwarted goals increase college educated Americans’ endorsement of whatever norm is salient: prowar or antiwar. Generalizing the model beyond violent means, Experiment 5 demonstrates that goal-thwarted Europeans report increased willingness to volunteer for refugee support activities if they perceive strong social norms to volunteer. Altogether, these findings support a frustration-affirmation model rather than frustration-aggression, whereby thwarted goals increase compliance with perceived norms for behavior, which can increase endorsement of violent means such as guns and war, but also nonviolent charitable actions.

In the current study, we seek to extend the literature on individual differences and negotiation by testing theory regarding how dispositional traits, namely gender-based rejection sensitivity (RS) (i.e., how an individual processes and handles rejection attributed to their gender; London, Downey, Romero-Canyas, Rattan, & Tyson, 2012) and Big Five personalities—may contribute to salary negotiation initiation. Also, because a negotiation involves two parties, the present investigation tests for gender differences in the dyad (gender of participant x gender of negotiation counterpart) and how this impacts the propensity to initiate a negotiation. In summary, we found that women are higher in politeness and compassion than men but neither of these personality traits were related to the propensity to initiate a negotiation. Rather, withdrawal was negatively related, and assertiveness was positively related to initiating negotiations. And, gender-based RS mediated the relationship between withdrawal and initiating negotiations. We also found evidence supporting the hypothesis that women are less likely to initiate a negotiation, but that this gender difference only exists with a male boss. This study aims to guide the literature and practice to see how gender-based RS, and RS in general, are both relevant in the workplace. It also hopes to promote more conversation of gender related issues in organizations.",4/16/18,9/28/22 0:20,10/22/22 20:26,9/28/22 0:20,,,,,,,You Get What You’re Not Afraid to Ask For,,,,,,,eng,,,,,scholarship.rice.edu,,Accepted: 2019-05-17T14:49:55Z,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/KBF79Y47/Reyes_2018_You Get What You’re Not Afraid to Ask For.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/NS773WTQ/105719.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, little has been said about potential limitations of ethical leadership, particularly boundary conditions involving the same person perceived to display ethical leadership. Drawing on conservation of resources theory, we argue that supervisor-induced hindrance stress and job hindrance stress are factors linked to the supervisor and work environment that may limit the positive impact of ethical leadership on employee deviance and turnover intentions. Specifically, we expect that high levels of hindrance stress drain resources, specifically perceptions of social support, by inhibiting the completion of work, particularly in combination with the high expectations of ethical leaders. We test our model across two time-lagged field studies (N = 310 and N = 299). Our results demonstrate that supervisor-induced hindrance stress mitigates some of the beneficial impact of ethical leadership and that job hindrance stress further strains these relationships. Overall, our results suggest that both forms of hindrance stress jointly impact the effectiveness of ethical leadership on important outcomes, and do so partly because of their influence on perceived social support.

This study sought to further explore these patterns by extending existing research in 3 ways in a sample of 335 targets and 548 informants. First, unlike previous research that has focused nearly exclusively on normal range traits with potentially limited clinical relevance or personality disorder categories with questionable validity, we assessed personality using a comprehensive model of maladaptive traits. Second, we gathered 4 sets of ratings: target self-ratings, informant ratings of targets, targets’ metaperceptions of how they believe targets would rate them, and informant metaperceptions of how they believe targets would rate themselves. Third, we compared the ratings of informants with different relationships to the targets, including fathers, mothers, siblings, friends, and romantic partners. Results suggest that the degree to which targets and informants agree differs depending on the trait being rated and whether targets or informants metaperceived their trait ratings, and that these differences are particularly apparent when examined within specific kinds of relationships. These results have implications for which informants clinicians might select in clinical personality assessment, as well as for future research on the multimethod assessment of maladaptive traits.

Emic (culture-specific) traits measured by the CPAI-2 are purportedly specific to the Chinese culture and argued to not be fully captured by the consensus Big Five personality trait taxonomy. Research suggests that CPAI-2 traits may have unique predictive power, especially in non-Western contexts. However, research has been hampered by several limitations of the measure. The inventory is proprietary and long, with 341 items forming 28 scales and four factors. Cross-cultural personality research would benefit from a short, public-domain analogue to the CPAI-2 to permit assessment in a wider range of contexts. Using two analytic approaches—item factor analysis and a genetic algorithm (Yarkoni, 2018)—we developed two short, public-domain measures to assess the 11 emic CPAI-2 scales that have no clear analogues in the current public-domain personality measure library. When examining the resulting measures’ factor structure, reliability, and criterion-related validity, we see that both short-form measures adequately replicate the pattern of correlations exhibited by the full-form measure as well as the original CPAI-2.

As a result, it is difficult to know whether low employee-rated fairness reflects managers who are truly violating justice rules, or whether it instead points to employees who are unusually strict in their perceptions. Drawing on fairness heuristic theory and conceptualizations of personality, we introduce fairness propensity—a tendency to view events, people, and organizations as fair. We theorize that fairness propensity is predicted—in part—by life narrative themes and trait dispositions that are communal in nature, given the relevance of fairness to relationships. We further theorize that fairness propensity shapes perceptions of overall fairness by influencing both “fairness anchors”—the first impressions of how fair authorities are—and perceptions of adherence to justice rules. A field study using employees from multiple organizations supported these predictions, even when controlling for other personality variables in the justice domain.

Although implicit theories would seem to have important mental health implications, the research linking them with clinical applications is limited. To address this gap, we assessed how implicit theories of anxiety, emotion, intelligence, and personality related to various symptoms of anxiety and depression, emotion-regulation strategies, and hypothetical treatment choices (e.g., medication versus therapy) in two undergraduate samples. Across both samples, individuals who believed their attributes could change reported fewer mental health symptoms, greater use of cognitive reappraisal, and were more likely to choose individual therapy over medication.

By integrating theoretical arguments related to role identities, self-conscious emotions, and identity maintenance, we propose that parental identity threat provokes working parents’ shame, which then results in disparate cross-domain outcomes in the form of reduced work productivity and enhanced investment in parenting. We further explain that emotional stability serves as a first-stage moderator of the proposed mediated relationships. Specifically, working parents with higher (vs. lower) emotional stability respond to parental identity threat with weaker shame reactions that then lessen the effects onto work productivity and investment in parenting. We tested our predictions across three studies: an experiment, a multisource field study involving working parent–spouse dyads, and a time-lagged experience sampling study across 15 days also using working parent–spouse dyads. Altogether, our findings generally support our predictions. Theoretical and practical implications and future direction are discussed.

We furthermore explored intrinsic motivation as a motivational mediator and trait competitiveness as an individual difference moderator of the effect of competition on brainstorming performance. Principal Results Adding competition to a brainstorming task improved both the creativity (d = 0.371) and quantity (7.72 additional ideas; d = 0.563) of brainstorming in comparison to a control group. Trait competitiveness did not moderate this relationship, such that a person's competitiveness did not change the effectiveness of competition. Intrinsic motivation also did not mediate the relationship between the game element and performance. Major Conclusions Competition, even implemented as the sole game element in gamification, can improve human performance.

This is a 106&thinsp;% increase from that of the previous decade. In 2013, Norway therefore launched the National Avalanche Warning Service (NAWS), which provides avalanche warnings to transport and preparedness authorities and to the public. Previous studies suggest that avalanche warnings are used extensively in trip and preparedness planning and have a relatively strong influence on the decisions people make in order to reduce risk. However, no evaluation concerning how efficiently the warnings are communicated and understood has been done to date in Norway. Avalanche warnings communicate complex natural phenomena with a variable complexity and level of uncertainty about both the future and the present. In order to manage avalanche risk successfully, it is fundamental that the warning message can be understood and translated into practice by a wide range of different user groups. Users with little or no avalanche competence may need simple information to decide when to stay away from avalanche terrain, while professional users may need advanced technical details in order to make their decisions. To evaluate how different modes of communication are understood, and how efficiently the informational content is communicated, we designed and implemented a web-based user survey. The modes of presentation were based on the Varsom.no 2017 version (Varsom.no being the national portal for natural hazard warnings in Norway). We first used a panel of 110 experts from NAWS to answer the survey, and used their answers to establish the indented message of the avalanche warning. We thereafter received responses from 264 users and compared their answers to those of the NAWS experts for the different modes of communication. We developed a method, the comprehension effectiveness score, to test the comprehension. Our empirical analyses suggest that most users find the warning service to be useful and well suited to their needs. However, the effectiveness of a warnings seems to be influenced by the competency of the user and the complexity of the scenarios. We discuss the findings and make recommendations on how to improve communication of avalanche warnings.</p>",9/20/18,9/28/22 0:20,9/28/22 0:20,9/28/22 0:20,2537-2559,,9,18,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,nhess.copernicus.org,,Publisher: Copernicus GmbH,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/Y5RA2D4S/Engeset et al_2018_Communicating public avalanche warnings – what works.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/I36Q9BQ9/2018.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we consider how one key risk variable might inform our understanding of variation in suicidal ideation: emotion-related impulsivity, the trait-like tendency towards unconstrained speech, behaviour, and cognition in the face of intense emotions. We hypothesized that emotion-related impulsivity would be tied to specific features, including severity, perceived lack of controllability, more rapidly fluctuating course, higher scores on a measure of acute suicidal affective disturbance, and more emotional and cognitive disturbance as antecedents. Methods We recruited two samples of adults (Ns = 421, 221) through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), with oversampling of those with suicidal ideation. Both samples completed psychometrically sound self-report measures online to assess emotion- and non-emotion-related dimensions of impulsivity and characteristics of suicidal ideation. Results One form of emotion-related impulsivity related to the severity, uncontrollability, dynamic course, and affective and cognitive precursors of ideation.

Findings are expected to have a practical meaning for literature marketing by answering questions such as which kind of advertising message, promotional or prevention-framed is better to be used, whether information about the author have an impact on book choice and how this impact differs in accordance with the type of information.  Results from three experiments have provided evidence supporting an impact of authors name on book choice. Study 2 have revealed a moderating role of regulatory focus, so that new books by unknown authors are more likely to be chosen by promotion-focused individuals, and alike effect is lower for books by well-known authors.

External information had a positive impact on choice intentions, which differed according to the type of description and across two author awareness conditions.

This failure to make optimal decisions may occur because employees do not utilize deliberative processes (e.g., systematically gathering information, evaluating choice alternatives, taking time to decide etc.). Accordingly, the goal of the present study was to propose an integrative model of some antecedents and consequences of deliberative decision making within personnel selection. Data gathered from 322 hiring managers indicated that when managers felt accountable for their hiring decisions and possessed a deliberative decision making style, they were more likely to report making hiring decisions in a deliberative manner. This use of deliberation was, in turn, associated with high quality decisions (i.e., low regret, high satisfaction, and high performance ratings of the person that was hired). The results also indicated the relationship between accountability and decision quality was mediated by deliberative processes. These findings were consistent across multiple hiring decisions. Importantly, these results did not emerge when intuitive processes/style were examined. Collectively, these results help establish the ecological validity of various theories of decision making and specify that deliberative processes are associated with high quality selection decisions. These results can be leveraged by organizations who are interested in encouraging employees to utilize deliberative processes. Given the benefits of deliberative processes, these results may also be leveraged by workers who are interested in achieving higher task performance in their jobs.",2019,9/28/22 0:21,10/22/22 20:34,9/28/22 0:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en_US,,,,,krex.k-state.edu,,Accepted: 2019-02-06T17:39:54Z,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/7LUPW7L4/39415.html; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/Y7T3DHQS/Voss_2019_Modeling antecedents and consequences of deliberative decision making within.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of time remains an understudied concept with creativity, especially with how people differ in the ways they think about time. We explore the role these individual differences, called temporal individual differences, have with creativity, offering initial hypotheses for four traits: time urgency, pacing style, temporal focus, and polychronicity. We examined whether these traits relate to creativity similarly across multiple domains, different conceptualizations of creativity, and whether these relationships are linear or curvilinear. Adults from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (N = 214) completed a number of temporal individual difference measures, three conceptualizations of creativity (self-perceptions, activity, and achievement), and Big Five traits. The results indicate that temporal traits did not differentially relate to creativity across domains, but did with regard to different conceptualizations of creativity. These relationships were both linear and curvilinear, depending on the temporal trait. The results highlight that temporal individual differences impact creativity in unique ways, warranting further investigation.

Specifically, we propose an indirect relationship between a group member’s lack of status and enhancement behaviour, through his or her high-arousal negative affective reactions, and we cast a member’s status striving as a key motivational boundary condition for this indirect association. We tested our predictions across three studies, namely (1) a scenario experiment, (2) a critical-incident recall design and (3) an organizational survey study. Results demonstrated an interactive relationship of perceived status and status striving with high-arousal negative affect, such that lower (rather than higher) status triggered high-arousal negative affective reactions among individuals with higher (but not lower) status striving.

The current research explored how older workers, vis-à-vis younger workers, react to perceptions of fairness. Integrating socioemotional selectivity theory and the multiple needs theory of organizational justice, we generated novel predictions regarding the relations between perceptions of workplace justice, emotional exhaustion, and employee deviance. Specifically, we hypothesized and found that employee age moderates the negative relation between justice facets and deviance (Study 1) and emotional exhaustion (Study 2). We also found that emotional exhaustion mediates the differential effects of justice on deviance, and that this relation depends on employee age (Study 2). Relative to younger workers, older workers are more sensitive to informational and interpersonal justice; in contrast, relative to older workers, younger workers are more sensitive to distributive and procedural justice.

But, how do employees enact courageous behavior in this regard, and what are the social implications of these courageous acts on stigmatized group members who witness them at work? To begin examining these questions, we conducted 4 studies using qualitative and quantitative data collected from 428 transgender employees. Drawing on the core principles of sociometer theory, we argue that these acts of oppositional courage serve an important symbolic function in the eyes of transgender employees in that they convey a powerful, public message regarding their value as organizational members. This message of value likely has key implications for their organization-based self-esteem (OBSE) and, in turn, their job attitudes and wellbeing. In Study 1, we employed a critical incident technique to generate qualitative accounts of participants’ exposure to these courageous acts in support of their trans identities at work. In Study 2, we experimentally manipulated trans participants’ exposure to these behaviors to examine their impact on individuals’ anticipated levels of OBSE. In Study 3, we developed a measure of oppositional courage and conducted tests of its construct validity. In Study 4, using a time-lagged survey design, we found that trans employees’ perceptions of oppositional courage were positively related to their job satisfaction and negatively related to their emotional exhaustion via their OBSE. Yet, these indirect effects were moderated by the centrality of participants’ trans identity.

Our research examines this phenomenon, termed unanswered support. Drawing from Self-Determination Theory, we expected that lower need satisfaction would mediate the negative relationship between unanswered support and its predicted outcomes (well-being, performance, and relational outcomes). We also expected that attributions for the lack of support would moderate these indirect effects. In Study 1, 280 employees in the United Kingdom took part in a quasi-experimental field study, where we examined the nature of the relationships between the variables. In Study 2, we recruited 267 undergraduate students at an Australian university and experimentally manipulated unanswered support during a work simulation to investigate its causal effects. Across both studies, unanswered support indirectly affected the outcomes through lower need satisfaction. There was minimal evidence for the hypothesized moderating role of attributions. Unanswered supervisor support appears to reduce employees’ psychological need satisfaction, negatively impacting how they feel, behave, and connect with others. Our research highlights the importance of leaders answering requests for support, and the findings have implications for employees, supervisors, and organizations.

This suggests both its importance and its dual nature that was recently categorized into obsessive passions (OP) and harmonious passions (HP). OP, unlike HP, is known to be associated with adverse psychological wellbeing. Although, many outcome studies on passion exist, little is known about what contributes to the development of OP, and no study has examined possible strategies to decrease levels of OP or increase levels of HP. Accordingly, the present research examines these questions in the context of OP for studying. In Study 1, parenting style was evaluated as a potential contributor to the development of OP for studying among university students with varying levels of obsessive passion (n = 253). Perfectionism, achievement goals, burnout, self-compassion, leisure-time satisfaction, and life satisfaction were explored for their mediation effects, and implicit theories of intelligence and sociodemographic characteristics were examined for their moderation effects. Although authoritarian parenting was associated with lower life satisfaction, contrary to what was expected, permissive parenting style was significantly associated with OP, and this relationship was mediated by mastery goal achievement. In Study 2, self-affirmation (SA) essay writing was examined for its helpfulness in transforming OP into HP and in reducing the negativities associated with high OP (Cohen & Sherman, 2014). In a sample of university students whose OP levels were identified as “high” (n = 178), SA writing, compared to control writing, did not establish a healthier balance between HP and OP, nor did it reduce negativities related to OP. The limited findings are contextualized within the domain of studying among university students. Overall, the results suggest that the origins of OP do not rest upon an authoritarian parenting style and that a single dose of SA administration was not efficacious in altering levels of OP and HP. This study, however, nonetheless offers an initial step in the exploration of preventative and treatment strategies for OP. Future research should follow, by shifting the attention of passion research from outcome studies to the identification of risk factors and interventions.",2018,9/28/22 0:21,10/22/22 17:55,9/28/22 0:21,,,,,,,Obsessive passion for studying,,,,,,,eng,info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess,,,,mspace.lib.umanitoba.ca,,Accepted: 2018-09-13T18:46:09Z,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/YNW4Q3K8/33353.html; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/74EG55F3/Wang_2018_Obsessive passion for studying.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experimental research has identified pain as a determinant of alcohol use proxies that has its influence via negative affect (i.e. mediation effect). Although experimental research has shown that acceptance coping reduces pain-related negative affect, such effects have not been examined within the context of the pain and alcohol relationship. The purpose of this study was to test acceptance coping (vs. distraction) as a moderator of the previously established mediation model. Based on a randomized 2x2 between-subjects repeated-measures experimental design, pain-free hazardous drinkers (N = 135) were randomly assigned to receive acceptance or distraction coping training. They were asked to use the strategy while receiving a painful or non-painful acute stimulus. It was hypothesized that the effects of pain condition on negative affect would be weaker among those who received acceptance training, which would, in turn, result in lower ratings on alcohol use proxy measures vs. those receiving distraction. The indirect effects of coping condition were non-significant and there were no pain condition X coping condition effects on negative affect. Given this, the moderator was removed, and a simple mediation model was tested. Results showed significant indirect effects for alcohol urge through negative affect. Pain condition predicted increases in negative affect, but negative affect did not effect alcohol use proxies. Results suggest that there are no differences between acceptance and distraction coping in ameliorating the effects of acute pain on negative affect and alcohol use proxies. The previous mediation model was partially replicated. Findings provide information that may accelerate the design of interventions to curtail drinking for pain-coping by better understanding the utility of acceptance training and the pain and alcohol relation.",2021,9/28/22 0:21,10/22/22 19:59,9/28/22 0:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798535510873,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/KUT388B5/Moskal_2021_Acceptance Versus Distraction as Coping Strategies for Acute Pain and.pdf,,,Acceptance training; Alcohol; Physical pain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The framework specified was refined throughout, given the empirical findings. The second contribution is the creation of a psychological scale to measure the conceptualized individual-level trait of workplace uncertainty tolerance. I executed three studies in three phases to establish construct validity of the scale. In phase one, an initial set of items was generated and assessed for content validity. The second phase evaluated the refined set of items for factor structure and psychometric properties.

Typically, the empirical research on alexithymia has measured the construct with the TAS-20, currently the most widely used self-report measure of alexithymia. However, questions have been raised on the (discriminant) content validity of this measure, that is whether it measures alexithymia in a relevant and comprehensive manner without contamination from related constructs. This study assessed the content validity and discriminant content validity of the TAS-20 items using the Discriminant Content Validity (DCV) methodology. Methods: Via an online tool, participants (n = 81) were presented with the TAS-20 items and items of related constructs (i.e. anxiety, depression, and health anxiety). Items were rated against construct deﬁnitions (i.e. alexithymia, difficulty identifying feelings, difficulty describing feelings, externallyoriented thinking, limited imaginal capacity, anxiety, depression, and health anxiety) to determine whether they measured a particular construct (no/yes/yes, when reversed scored). Judges’ conﬁdence in each assessment was also assessed (0-100%) and used to establish quantitative estimates of content validity for each item. Results: Data of 74 participants were analyzed using linear mixed effects models. The results revealed that all items from the included anxiety, depression, and health anxiety measures assessed the intended construct well and scored significantly higher on the intended construct than on any other construct. This was not the case for the TAS-20 items, where only 10 out of the 20 items measured alexithymia. In particular, the majority of these items were equally well perceived as measures of both the difficulty identifying feelings and the difficulty describing feelings constructs. Two items were perceived as measures of health anxiety, of which one was also found to measure anxiety. The other TAS-20 items were not perceived by participants as measures of any of the overarching constructs. Only one item of the externally-oriented thinking scale was identified to measure the externally-oriented thinking construct.

Thus, it may be important to determine whether individuals perceive their problems as distressing, as only those who are distressed by their problems may be motivated to change their cannabis use or benefit from cannabis-related interventions. The current study examined cannabis-related problem distress, its relation to motivation to change cannabis use, and whether problem distress impacted outcomes of a problem-focused online PFI. Past-month cannabis-using undergraduates who endorsed experiencing at least one cannabis-related problem in the past 3 months were randomized to a PFI (n = 102) or a personalized normative feedback (PNF)-only condition (n = 102). Problem distress was robustly related to readiness, importance, and confidence to change cannabis use at baseline. Among those with high levels of problem distress at baseline, those in the PFI condition reported a greater decrease in problems than those in the PNF-only condition. This was not the case among those with lower levels of problem distress. Further, the number of cannabis-related problems did not moderate intervention outcomes.

Consequently, there are various labels and measurement tools for these potentially overlapping constructs, resulting in a lack of conceptual clarity and inconsistent measurement of positive exchanges between the domains throughout the literature. The widespread interchangeable use of these construct labels hinders both theoretical and practical development of this phenomenon. In order to address these limitations, the present study develops and validates a comprehensive measure representing the positive side of the work-life interface, which is referred to as positive spillover. The measure encompasses previously developed measures of work-life enrichment, facilitation, and positive spillover, along with newly generated items to best capture facets underlying the positive transfers between work and life. Using six samples of data, several analyses were conducted to create a synthesized, holistic representation of the positive side of the work-life interface, including qualitative analyses, exploratory factors analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and both single and multi-timepoint scale validation.",7/20/21,9/28/22 0:22,10/22/22 17:52,9/28/22 0:22,,,,,,,Measuring the Positive Side of the Work-Life Interface,,,,,,,en,EMBARGO_NOT_AUBURN,,,,etd.auburn.edu,,Accepted: 2021-07-20T20:01:12Z,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/UUI2XU3F/Shifrin_2021_Measuring the Positive Side of the Work-Life Interface.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/PSYN69BM/7849.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

White allies possess social power to change the status quo by confronting racism. Although confrontation reduces biased behavior and prejudiced attitudes, many people refrain from spontaneously confronting. Persuasive appeals may encourage ally confronting. When these appeals are strategically framed in a manner that matches people’s regulatory orientation, they are expected to experience a sense of fit, which makes them feel better about the tasks they are engaged in. Two studies tested whether experiencing regulatory fit would enhance the persuasiveness of a pro-confrontation message. Participants were primed with a prevention or promotion regulatory focus before seeing a pro-confrontation message framed in terms of either approaching egalitarianism or avoiding prejudice. Results showed that relative to non-fit, experiencing regulatory fit did not affect feeling right about the pro-confrontation message nor did it produce shifts in confrontation behavior or future confrontation intentions. All participants felt right about the pro-confrontation message, and feeling right led to confrontation behavior (Study 2). A majority of participants in both studies confronted the racist comment.

However, too often, the buzz about worker well-being, enthusiasm for new programs to promote it and interest to research it, have not been accompanied by universal enthusiasm for scientific measurement. Aim to bridge this gap, we address three questions. To address the question ‘What is worker well-being?’, we explain that worker well-being is a multi-facetted concept and that it can be operationalized in a variety of constructs. We propose a four-dimensional taxonomy of worker well-being constructs to illustrate the concept’s complexity and classify ten constructs within this taxonomy. To answer the question ‘How can worker well-being constructs be measured?’, we present two aspects of measures: measure obtrusiveness (i.e., the extent to which obtaining a measure interferes with workers’ experiences) and measure type (i.e., closed question survey, word, behavioral and physiological). We illustrate the diversity of measures across our taxonomy and uncover some hitherto under-appreciated avenues for measuring worker well-being. Finally, we address the question ‘How should a worker well-being measure be selected?’ by discussing conceptual, methodological, practical and ethical considerations when selecting a measure. We summarize these considerations in a short checklist. It is our hope that with this study researchers – working in organizations, in academia or both – will feel more competent to find effective strategies for the measurement worker well-being and eventually make policies and choices with a better understanding of what drives worker well-being.",4/1/22,9/28/22 0:22,9/28/22 0:22,9/28/22 0:22,795-832,,2,17,,Applied Research Quality Life,Worker Well-Being,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/22E2A2EL/Wijngaards et al_2022_Worker Well-Being.pdf,,,Survey; Employee well-being; Well-being; Construct; Measure; Work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The wh-questions used as experimental stimuli were elicited from four speakers in contexts likely to lead to either information-seeking or non-informationseeking uses. The speakers produced distinct tunes in response to the contexts; acoustic analysis indicates these are best analysed as L*+H L-!H% (rising), and L+H* L-L% (flat). In a perception experiment where participants heard the questions out of context, they chose answers providing information significantly more frequently after high-ending than flat-ending questions, confirming hypothesis (a). In a second experiment testing hypotheses (b) and (c), participants evaluated wh-questions for appropriateness and politeness in information- and non-information-seeking contexts. High-ending questions were rated more appropriate in information-seeking contexts, and more polite independently of context relative to their flat-ending counterparts. Finally, two follow-up experiments showed that the interpretation of the two tunes was not affected by voice characteristics of individual speakers, and confirmed a participant preference for the high-ending tune.

A methodological limitation of such studies is their high attrition rate, particularly owing to participants who stop responding after initial study enrollment. Importantly, study dropout can introduce systematic biases that may affect the interpretability of results. Objective: Based on a previously collected sample (baseline n=654), here we investigated potential determinants of study attrition in web-based prospective studies on psychedelic use. Methods: Logistic regression models were used to examine demographic, psychological trait and state, and psychedelic-specific predictors of dropout. Predictors were assessed 1 week before, 1 day after, and 2 weeks after psychedelic use, with attrition being defined as noncompletion of the key endpoint 4 weeks post experience. Results: Predictors of attrition were found among demographic variables including age (β=0.024; P=.007) and educational levels, as well as personality traits, specifically conscientiousness (β=–0.079; P=.02) and extraversion (β=0.082; P=.01). Contrary to prior hypotheses, neither baseline attitudes toward psychedelics nor the intensity of acute challenging experiences were predictive of dropout. Conclusions: The baseline predictors of attrition identified here are consistent with those reported in longitudinal studies in other scientific disciplines, suggesting their transdisciplinary relevance. Moreover, the lack of an association between attrition and psychedelic advocacy or negative drug experiences in our sample contextualizes concerns about problematic biases in these and related data.",7/28/21,9/28/22 0:22,9/28/22 0:22,9/28/22 0:22,e25973,,7,23,,,"Turn on, Tune in, and Drop out",,,,,,,EN,,,,,www.jmir.org,,"Company: Journal of Medical Internet Research Distributor: Journal of Medical Internet Research Institution: Journal of Medical Internet Research Label: Journal of Medical Internet Research Publisher: JMIR Publications Inc., Toronto, Canada",,"/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/3C4ZQC5E/Hübner et al_2021_Turn on, Tune in, and Drop out.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/36AWQN22/e25973.html",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, different versions of loving-kindness meditation (LKM) were compared to see which one is associated with the lowest implicit bias levels. Participants followed an 8-minute LKM audio clip where the instructions were altered to manipulate the focus of the meditation across three groups. The meditation directed them to send their love and positive energy to either themselves, younger peers, or the elderly population. Then, participants took an age-based implicit association test (IA T) to compare whether the manipulation led to differences in implicit bias across groups. Additionally, participants were asked to rate their experience of several positive emotions to see if the conditions caused differences in types of positive emotion ( either other-regarding or non-other-regarding) and whether these different types of positive emotions mediated the effects of LKM focus on implicit bias. The results revealed that LKM focus did not have a significant impact on differences in positive emotions or implicit bias, and the mediating effect of other-regarding positive emotions on the relationship between LKM focus and implicit bias was not observed. The results suggest the subject of meditative focus may be a negligible factor when it comes to influencing positive emotion and implicit bias levels.",2022-05,9/28/22 0:22,10/22/22 17:50,9/28/22 0:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en_US,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,,,,soar.suny.edu,,Accepted: 2022-05-23T18:31:44Z,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/IMYTI7GC/Saitta_2022_Does the focus of loving-kindness meditation matter for reducing implicit bias.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/FC6D9FHZ/7189.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also assessed if personality, need for cognition (NFC), and fixed versus incremental theories of intelligence (TOI) moderate these effects. As predicted, individuals in the positive condition had more positive CCT expectations relative to those in the negative condition. Individuals with incremental TOI had more positive expectations than fixed TOI individuals, regardless of message condition. Higher NFC and open-mindedness were associated with more positive expectations in the positive condition and more negative expectations in the negative condition. Agreeableness was associated with more positive expectations in the positive condition.

While the research is limited, several personal accounts of 1st and 2nd generation Korean-Americans (Gaertner, 2012; Kim, Huhr & Kim, 1993; Takeshita & Leong, 2007; Zeon, 1994) show the need to distinguish between the generations. This study explored the relationship between perceived work/family demand and work-family conflict, and how ethnicity and collectivism affected this relationship. Perceived work/family demand was explored as a mediator for the relationship between ethnicity and work-family conflict and between collectivism and work-family conflict. Results indicated that collectivism was a significant mediator of the relationship between demand and work-family conflict, whereas ethnicity was not.",,9/28/22 0:22,10/22/22 17:45,,48,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/WBT9KQX8/Park - Work-Family Conflict in Korean-Americans.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These behaviors are often illegal and risk harm to others, motivating research to understand and manage them. However, the potential moderating role of ER on the relationship between psychopathy and ASB, and how this may vary by gender, is unknown. The present study examined this question using vagally mediated high frequency heart rate variability (HRV) as an autonomic nervous system correlate of ER. We hypothesized that meanness and disinhibition traits influence on ASB would be buffered by high resting HRV, and further vary by gender. Undergraduate students (n = 122, 65% female, ages 18–24 years, 71% Caucasian) reported on psychopathic traits and ASB prior to baseline HRV assessment. Psychopathic disinhibition uniquely predicted ASB in men and women. The role of meanness was qualified by gender and HRV. Specifically, high HRV in women buffered against high meanness expression as ASB, while the relationship was not significant for men. Findings suggest that expression of certain psychopathic traits as ASB may depend upon one’s gender and cardiac vagal ER processes. Thus, it may be helpful to consider biological factors in assessment and treatment of personality traits and antisocial behavior.",12/1/20,9/28/22 0:23,9/28/22 0:23,9/28/22 0:23,637-646,,4,42,,J Psychopathol Behav Assess,Antisocial Behavior,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/E75FKX9W/Delk et al_2020_Antisocial Behavior.pdf,,,Psychopathy; Gender; Emotion regulation; Antisocial behavior; Heart rate variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Materials & Methods: An online convenience sample of adult nicotine and/or cannabis vape users residing in the United States completed a 60 min survey on sociodemographic characteristics, cannabis and/or nicotine vape use behaviors and dependence, reasons for vape use, and perceptions of benefits and harms. After data cleaning, we compared dual vs. nicotine-only and cannabis-only vape users with univariate statistics and step-wise hierarchical linear regression analyses. Additionally, we assessed the factor structure, internal consistency, and criterion and convergent validity of the Penn State Cannabis Vaping Dependence Index (PSCVDI). Results: The final sample included 357 dual, 40 cannabis, and 106 nicotine vape users. Compared to nicotine- and cannabis-only vapers, dual vapers started using their nicotine and cannabis vapes at a younger age (p < 0.001), used them for more years (p < 0.001), and were less likely to use their nicotine vape to replace combustible cigarettes (p = 0.047). Dual users vs. single-substance users did not have significantly higher nicotine or cannabis vape dependence scores after controlling for sociodemographic and use behaviors. The PSCVDI showed adequate validity for measuring cannabis vape dependence.

In particular, we note the conceptual and empirical distinctions between dimensions of mindfulness (i.e., mindful awareness and mindful acceptance) and investigate their respective abilities to regulate workplace aggression. In an experimental study (Study 1), a multiwave field study (Study 2a), and a daily diary study (Study 2b), we established that the awareness dimension, rather than the acceptance dimension, of mindfulness plays a more critical role in attenuating the association between hostility and aggression. In a second multiwave field study (Study 3), we found that mindful awareness moderates the association between hostility and aggression by reducing the extent to which individuals use dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies (i.e., surface acting), rather than by reducing the extent to which individuals engage in dysfunctional thought processes (i.e., rumination). The findings are discussed in terms of the implications of differentiating the dimensions and mechanisms of mindfulness for regulating workplace aggression.

Throughout most of the pandemic, mitigating its spread has relied on human behavior, namely on adherence to protective behaviors (e.g., wearing a face mask). This research proposes that Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) can contribute to understanding differences in individual adherence to COVID-19 behavioral guidelines. PMT identifies four fundamental cognitive components that drive responses to fear appeals: perceptions of susceptibility (to the disease), severity (of the disease), self-efficacy (to protect oneself), and response efficacy (i.e., recommended behaviors’ effectiveness). Two online self-report studies assessed PMT components’ capacity to predict adherence to protective behaviors concurrently and across culturally different countries (Israel, Germany, India; Study 1), and again at six-week follow-up (Israeli participants; Study 2). Study 1’s findings indicate excellent fit of the PMT model, with about half of the variance in adherence explained. No significant differences were found between participants from Israel (n = 917), Germany (n = 222) and India (n = 160). Study 2 (n = 711) confirmed that PMT components continue to predict adherence after six weeks. In both studies, response efficacy was the PMT component most strongly associated with adherence levels. This study demonstrates that PMT can serve as a theoretical framework to better understand differences in adherence to COVID-19 protective behaviors. The findings may further inform the design of adherence-promoting communications, suggesting that it may be beneficial to highlight response efficacy in such messages.",1/10/22,9/28/22 0:23,9/28/22 0:23,9/28/22 0:23,10-Jan,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/08964289.2021.2021383 PMID: 35000566,,,,,COVID-19; adherence; health behavior; protection motivation theory; response efficacy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of multitasking fit in employee job satisfaction and turnover intentions,Dissertations,,,,https://etd.auburn.edu//handle/10415/7341,"Person-job (P-J) fit refers to the degree of congruence between an employee and their occupation. P-J fit is important for organizations to understand, because it predicts job satisfaction and turnover intentions, such that better P-J fit is associated with higher levels of job satisfaction and lower levels of turnover intentions. This research presented and examined multitasking fit, a specific conceptualization of P-J fit that compared an employee’s preference for multitasking with the extent to which multitasking is required or allowed in their job. A model of multitasking fit was analyzed in competition with a model of P-J fit to determine if multitasking fit better predicted job satisfaction and turnover intentions. Employees in real-world organizations were surveyed about their preference for multitasking, the extent to which their job required multitasking, their job satisfaction, and their turnover intentions. Results indicated that multitasking fit was not a better predictor of job satisfaction and turnover intentions than P-J fit. Furthermore, the present study examined the effects of conscientiousness and neuroticism on P-J fit. Employee conscientiousness was found to positively moderate the indirect effect of P-J fit on turnover intentions, via job satisfaction. This research indicated that organizations should assess prospective employees for their P-J fit and conscientiousness.

The conceptualisation and operationalisation of CSE as a unitary construct has been criticised in its failure to account for the distinctiveness of the subdomains. To address this concern, our study tested a bifactor model, enabling the specific factors (SE, GSE, N, and LOC) to be empirically represented, independently of the general factor (CSE). Adult participants (N = 331; 65% community members, 35% undergraduate students) completed an online survey with established Likert scales of the relevant constructs. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the bifactor model provided the best fit for the data, compared to traditional representations of CSE as a single-factor or higher-order model. Each specific factor explained significant variance beyond its expression in the general factor. Structural equation modelling showed that the bifactor model was also superior to the higher-order model in predicting life satisfaction, a known correlate of CSE. The specific factors SE and LOC (but not GSE or N) contributed additional predictive utility beyond the general factor.

Reinforcement, in both positive and negative formats, functions as one of the key underlying mechanisms contributing to the onset and maintenance of depression and substance use. Behavioral activation (BA) was developed based on the reinforcement theory. BA demonstrates efficacy towards the treatment of depression and substance use and it also has the potential to be a CST for Chinese individuals. Through three independent studies, the current project aims to develop a Chinese translated behavioral activation treatment (C-BA) for individuals seeking depression and substance use treatments in China. In the first study, the English version of the Reward Probability Index (RPI), a measure that aims to assess individual accessibility to environmental rewards, was translated into the Chinese language (C-RPI) and validated among 930 college students from China, Taiwan, and the United States. Findings support the psychometric properties of C-RPI. In the second study, an English behavioral activation treatment manual was translated into Chinese language and tested for feasibility and acceptability among six Chinese international students in the United States. Findings suggest that C-BA is well accepted by CIS and is feasible to be implemented among this population. CIS reported no cultural barriers in understanding C-BA components. In the third study, the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of C-BA was examined among 90 Chinese citizens seeking methadone treatment in Wuhan, China. Data support the high acceptability and feasibility of C-BA in substance use treatment settings, yet C-BA did not demonstrate initial efficacy over TAU on clinical outcomes.

Current interventions aimed at promoting positive health behaviors in this population have shown limited efficacy. However, prior research suggests that both mindfulness and autonomous motivation are important theoretical constructs in health promotion and disease prevention research and intervention. To date, limited research has been conducted to understand the relationship amongst mindfulness, autonomous motivation, and health behaviors. This study examined the relationship between mindfulness, autonomous motivation, and health behaviors in college students. Based on self-determination theory, it was hypothesized that autonomous motivation would mediate the relationship between mindfulness and health behaviors, specifically physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake. Participants were 187 college students who completed a series of online questionnaires including demographic information, mindfulness, autonomous motivation for physical activity and to eat fruits and vegetables, physical activity, and fruit and vegetable intake. Results indicated that autonomous motivation to eat fruits and vegetables mediated the association between mindfulness and fruit and vegetable intake. Similarly, autonomous motivation for physical activity mediated the association between mindfulness and physical activity. These findings support autonomous motivation as a mechanism through which mindfulness impacts health behaviors. Thus, mindfulness should be incorporated into the self-determination theory of health-behavior change and represents a promising avenue for health behavior intervention in college students.",,9/28/22 0:23,10/22/22 20:31,9/28/22 0:23,,,,,,,Mindfulness and health behaviors,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9781369286892,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/PLGFBEGZ/Coppersmith_Mindfulness and health behaviors.pdf,,,Psychology; Mindfulness; Fruits; Health and environmental sciences; Health behaviors; Physical activity; Self-determination theory; Vegetables,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The differential involvement hypothesis suggests that disproportionate sanctioning may be a function of racial differences in student misbehavior or characteristics that predispose them to misbehavior. Method Suspension data, risk behaviors, and aggressive attitudes from self-report surveys were collected from a statewide sample of 38,398 students attending 236 racially-diverse high schools. A series of school fixed-effect logistic and linear regression models were used to test behavioral and attitudinal forms of the differential involvement hypothesis. Results Racial differences in self-reported suspension could not be explained by different behavioral reasons for suspension (such as fighting, threatening others, and substance possession), by involvement in high risk behaviors of fighting, bullying, carrying a weapon, consuming alcohol, or using marijuana, or by aggressive attitudes that lead to hostile behavior. Conclusions Overall, these findings do not support the differential involvement hypothesis and although they do not establish the presence of bias, they strengthen concern that racial disparities are likely the result of differential decisions by school authorities.",2/1/17,9/28/22 0:23,9/28/22 0:23,9/28/22 0:23,298-308,,,73,,Children and Youth Services Review,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/R59VK4VQ/Huang_Cornell_2017_Student attitudes and behaviors as explanations for the Black-White suspension.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/5H4CY89I/S0190740917300105.html,,,Aggressive attitudes; Differential involvement; Out-of-school suspensions; Racial disparities; Student risk behavior,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A community sample (N = 1058, ages 18-66) completed an online survey assessing four core domains: restrained eating, trait food craving, uncontrolled eating, and emotional eating. In accordance with the CPMA, food craving emerged as a significant indirect effect of the association between restrained eating and both uncontrolled and emotional eating. Gender did not significantly moderate any direct or indirect associations, suggesting that gender may not change the pattern of association between restrained eating and different facets of overeating. Results suggest that treatments targeting binge eating behaviors may benefit from 1) explicitly addressing the activation of food craving rather than concentrating on reducing restrained eating and 2) recognizing that food craving may be an important gender-neutral target with the potential to reduce binge and overeating behaviors.

However, in industrial/organizational (I/O) psychology, it is still rarely applied. Instead, when there is a need to reduce survey length, the standard practice is to either reduce the number of constructs measured or to use short forms rather than full measures. The former is obviously unideal. The latter requires prioritizing the measurement of some items over that of others and can also quickly become time and labor intensive, as not all measures have established short forms. This dissertation presents three studies that compare the relatively unused methodology of PM against the common practice of using short forms. First, the two approaches are compared in three archival datasets, finding that PM consistently yields more accurate correlational estimates than short forms. Second, a Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to explore how this comparison may be affected by data characteristics, including the number of constructs, construct intercorrelations, sample size, amount of missingness, as well as different types of short forms. Average of all conditions simulated, short forms produce slightly more accurate estimates than PM when empirically developed short forms are readily available for use. When a part of the sample needs to be used to first develop short forms, the two approaches perform equivalently. When the selection of items for short forms strays from being purely empirical, PM outperforms short forms. Lastly, a qualitative survey exploring social science researchers’ knowledge about PM finds that most are not familiar with PM or have an inaccurate understanding of the concept despite working with surveys frequently. A number of research contexts are identified for which PM may not be suitable. Overall, the findings of this dissertation demonstrate that PM designs are technically effective in producing accurate estimates. Its effectiveness, along with its convenience, makes it a valuable survey design tool. It is apparent that the road to popularizing this technique within the I/O field will require much education in its understanding and application, and this dissertation serves as a first step in doing so.",2021,9/28/22 0:24,10/22/22 19:47,9/28/22 0:24,,,,,,,Planned Missingness,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798534692150,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/44S4T67A/Zhang_2021_Planned Missingness.pdf,,looks interesting,Psychometrics; Industrial/organizational psychology; Survey design; Monte Carlo; Planned missingness; Test and measurement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Informal learning refers to any learning that occurs outside of formal and structured instructional settings. The literature has recently called for validated and reliable measures of informal learning, following a growing body of evidence that informal learning is both extremely prevalent in the workplace and important to high performance at work.  Two connected studies were conducted to address this gap in the literature. In the first, a thorough literature review was conducted to identify a subset of informal learning that was intentional and observable at work. Six dimensions of informal learning were proposed to meet these criteria: planning, socializing, reflecting, experimenting, adapting, and scanning. Items were written and reviewed by subject matter experts. Participants were recruited from a research pool and an online MTurk pool to respond to the initial set of items and several additional scales used for convergent and discriminant validation. Analyses found strong support for a 23-item, five-factor model combining the planning and scanning dimensions and strong relationships between the dimensions and metacognition, motivation to learn, learning goal orientation, and a prior informal learning scale. Conversely, there were weak or negative relationships between the dimensions and prove performance goal orientation, as hypothesized. The second study was conducted to confirm the 23 item, five-factor model of the scale in a new, organizational sample and collect additional validity evidence by testing a model linking informal learning to self-regulation, support for learning, and job performance. Participants completed measures of the informal learning behavior scale, sleep quantity and quality, occupational self-efficacy, and support for learning in the organization. Responses were then matched to archival performance data. Analyses confirmed the hypothesized structure of the scale but found only some support for the proposed model. Sleep had no impact on either occupational self-efficacy or informal learning behaviors. Perceived support for learning was not related to informal learning behaviors. Occupational self-efficacy was related to informal learning, and the experimenting dimension predicted both job performance and job potential. The resulting scale is a reliable measure of five informal learning behavioral dimensions with a developing body of validity evidence supporting its use.",12/31/18,9/28/22 0:24,10/22/22 19:58,9/28/22 0:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright of the original work is retained by the author.,,,,mountainscholar.org,,Accepted: 2019-09-10T14:35:57Z Artwork Medium: born digital Interview Medium: born digital,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/TEFIJWT5/197345.html; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/SKSB76Y5/Willis_2018_Validating and implementing the informal learning behavior scale.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present seven studies that question this corrective view of human thinking. We focused on the very problem that has been widely featured as the paradigmatic illustration of the corrective view, the well-known bat-and-ball problem. A two-response paradigm in which people were required to give an initial response under time pressure and cognitive load allowed us to identify the presumed intuitive response that preceded the final response given after deliberation. Across our studies, we observe that correct final responses are often non-corrective in nature. Many reasoners who manage to answer the bat-and-ball problem correctly after deliberation already solved it correctly when they reasoned under conditions that minimised deliberation in the initial response phase. This suggests that sound bat-and-ball reasoners do not necessarily need to deliberate to correct their intuitions; their intuitions are often already correct.

In study (2) the validity parameter is tested in an independent sample of litigants. In study (3) the parameter is applied to an independent sample comprising cooperative and non-cooperative testees. Logistic regression analysis led to a derived validity parameter based on median reaction time and standard deviation. It performed satisfactorily in studies (2) and (3) (study 2 sensitivity=0.94, specificity=1.00; study 3 sensitivity=0.79, specificity=0.87).

However, no empirical research or official guidelines exist about how clinicians should proceed if a patient produces a non-valid SVT result. The purpose of this study was to examine whether confronting patients immediately after scoring in a non-valid range on a SVT would have an impact on subsequent symptom validity and memory tests performance. Archival patient data for 507 adults with clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS) (ages 18–76) were examined. All patients completed the Victoria Symptom Validity Test (VSVT), the Wechsler Memory Scale, 3rd edition (WMS III), and the Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd edition (BDI II). Although the majority (89%) of patients produced valid VSVT scores (the Valid group), 56 patients produced non-valid VSVT scores. Due to a change in clinical procedure, 28 of the 56 were confronted regarding their non-valid VSVT performances and were asked to complete the test a second time (the CONF group), while the remaining 28 proceeded with testing as usual following a non-valid score (the N-CONF group). Results showed that 68% of the CONF group produced valid VSVT scores on re-administration, as well as memory performances that were comparable to those of the Valid group. In contrast the N-CONF group produced memory scores that were significantly below the Valid group. This is the first study to provide empirical support for the effectiveness of intervention when patients exhibit inadequate effort on SVTs in clinical, non-forensic settings.",11/1/12,9/28/22 20:13,9/28/22 20:13,9/28/22 20:13,1296-1311,,8,26,,,Confronting Patients About Insufficient Effort,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/13854046.2012.722230 PMID: 23061472,,,,,Depression; Malingering; Symptom validity tests; Effort testing; Memory testing; Multiple sclerosis; Neuropsychological evaluation; Victoria Symptom Validity Test,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As expected, average sensitivity to the display depicting a changing heading angle was larger as the size of the change increased. In contrast, there was little evidence that infants responded to changes in the spatial position of the Focus of Expansion (FOE), nor was there a systematic left or right looking bias. For all measures, however, there were large differences between individuals and between different visits by the same individual. Taken together, these data confirm previous findings that prelocomotor infants detect heading direction changes of 20 deg or more, but cast doubt on the possibility that infants respond systematically to left or right shifts in the position of the FOE. More important, the data illustrate that some infants ignore even highly salient display differences, adopting instead a systematically biased pattern of responding, while others respond randomly a large fraction of the time.

We examined the impact of non-content-based invalid responding on the following Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF) content-based invalid responding indicators: Infrequent Responses (F-r), Infrequent Psychopathology Responses (FP-r), Infrequent Somatic Responses (FS), Symptom Validity (FBS-r), Response Bias Scale (RBS), Uncommon Virtues (L-r), and Adjustment Validity (K-r). In 4 samples from which invalid responders were excluded, we systematically inserted increasing percentages of random, acquiescent, or counter-acquiescent item responses ranging from 0% to 100% and examined the impact that non-content-based invalid response styles had on the content-based invalid responding indicators. F-r, FP-r, FS, RBS, and L-r were susceptible to non-content-based invalid responding, whereas FBS-r and K-r were unaffected. Individuals with Variable Response Inconsistency (VRIN-r) and True Response Inconsistency (TRIN-r) elevations were removed, and the frequencies of content-based invalid responding elevations were then reexamined for false indications of feigning. Findings were consistent across samples and emphasize the need to screen for non-content-based invalid responding before screening for content-based invalid responding in the assessment of personality and psychopathology. VRIN-r and TRIN-r were useful in detecting most—but not all—cases of non-content-based invalid responding. A small but meaningful percentage of the remaining individuals were misclassified as overreporters (i.e., false feigners) by FP-r and FS. Clinicians should interpret FP-r and FS with some caution in the presence of moderate levels of non-content-based invalid responding. Post hoc examinations of scale characteristics indicated that the most susceptible scales were brief, consisted of rarely endorsed items, included a relatively high percentage of true-keyed items, and required a low percentage of endorsed items to reach clinical significance.

After the low-rate contingencies were relaxed, higher response rates generally did not increase point earnings with random-interval scheduling, but did so with random-ratio scheduling. In both cases, shaped responding usually increased, and instructed responding usually continued at an unchanged low rate.

Thus, the current study specifically controlled for the impact of sex, a potential key issue within this area. In this study, 120 subjects (60 males) were randomly assigned to a WM load or control group and completed a decision-making task requiring rapid decisions. The task utilised three probability of loss conditions. The main findings centred on an interaction between sex and WM load, with males showing increased impulsive decision-making in WM load conditions, whereas females did not show a change in decision-making patterns under WM load.

However, the ability of clinicians to assess random responding when using short symptom inventories is also an important facet of reliably assessing psychopathology and psychological distress. Methods: This study assesses the effectiveness of a short symptom inventory, the Assessment of Depression Inventory (ADI), to assess random responding. Results: The responses of 335 clinical patients, 150 responses from a feigning population, and 1,000 generated random profiles were compared to determine if the Random and Reliability scales of the ADI could detect adequately random responses. Conclusions: Findings indicate that even scales as short as four items can be used to detect random responses in symptom inventories at levels equivalent to or better than longer multi-scale inventories.

This lack of usage may stem from fears of distorting treatment effects and uncertainty regarding which type to use (e.g., instructional manipulation checks [IMCs] or assessments of whether stimuli alter a latent independent variable of interest). Here, we first categorize the main variants and argue that factual manipulation checks (FMCs)—that is, objective questions about key elements of the experiment—can identify individual-level attentiveness to experimental information and, as a consequence, better enable researchers to diagnose experimental findings. We then find, through four replication studies, little evidence that FMC placement affects treatment effects, and that placing FMCs immediately post-outcome does not attenuate FMC passage rates. Additionally, FMC and IMC passage rates are only weakly related, suggesting that each technique identifies different sets of attentive subjects. Thus, unlike other methods, FMCs can confirm attentiveness to experimental protocols.",2019,9/28/22 19:58,10/5/22 23:12,9/28/22 19:58,234-249,,1,63,,,No Harm in Checking,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ajps.12396,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/5JHVHBK4/Kane and Barabas - 2019 - No Harm in Checking Using Factual Manipulation Ch.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Internet can be used to recruit broadly, enabling the recruitment of rare groups such as people with specific psychological disorders. However, Internet-based research relies on participant self-report to determine eligibility, and thus, data quality depends on participant honesty. For those rare groups, even low levels of participant dishonesty can lead to a substantial proportion of fraudulent survey responses, and all studies will include careless respondents who do not pay attention to questions, do not understand them, or provide intentionally wrong responses. Poor-quality responses should be thought of as categorically different from high-quality responses. Including these responses will lead to the overestimation of the prevalence of rare groups and incorrect estimates of scale reliability, means, and correlations between constructs. We demonstrate that for these reasons, including poor-quality responses—which are usually positively skewed—will lead to several data-quality problems including spurious associations between measures.

Nevertheless, there has been less research on the explicit selection of the response anchors. Constructing survey questions with equal-interval properties (i.e., interval or ratio data) is important if researchers plan to analyze their data using parametric statistics. As such, the primary objectives of the current study were to (a) determine the most common contexts in which summated rating scales are used (e.g., agreement, similarity, frequency, amount, and judgment), (b) determine the most commonly used anchors (e.g., strongly disagree, often, very good), and (c) provide empirical data on the conceptual distance between these anchors. We present the mean and standard deviation of scores for estimates of each anchor and the percentage of distribution overlap between the anchors. Our results provide researchers with data that can be used to guide the selection of verbal anchors with equal-interval properties so as to reduce measurement error and improve confidence in the results of subsequent analyses. We also conducted multiple empirical studies to examine the consequences of measuring constructs with unequal-interval anchors. A clear pattern of results is that correlations involving unequal-interval anchors are consistently weaker than correlations involving equal-interval anchors.

Although large online samples have many advantages for psychiatric research, some potential pitfalls of this research design are not widely understood. Here we detail circumstances in which entirely spurious correlations may arise between task behavior and symptom severity as a result of inadequate screening of careless or low-effort responding on psychiatric symptom surveys. Specifically, since many psychiatric symptom surveys have asymmetric ground-truth score distributions in the general population, participants who respond carelessly on these surveys will show apparently elevated symptom levels. If these participants are similarly careless in their task performance, and are not excluded from analysis, this may result in a spurious association between greater symptom scores and worse behavioral task performance. Here, we demonstrate exactly this pattern of results in N = 386 participants recruited online to complete a self-report symptom battery and a short reversal-learning choice task. We show that many behavior-symptom correlations are entirely abolished when participants flagged for careless responding on surveys are excluded from analysis. We also show that exclusion based on task performance alone is not sufficient to prevent these spurious correlations. Of note, we demonstrate that false-positive rates for these spurious correlations increase with sample size, contrary to common assumptions. We offer guidance on how researchers using this general experimental design can guard against this issue in future research; in particular, we recommend the adoption of screening methods for self-report measures that are currently uncommon in this field.",4/12/21,9/28/22 22:50,10/22/22 19:03,9/28/22 22:50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en-us,,,,,OSF Preprints,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/FYNWRKZP/Zorowitz et al. - 2021 - Inattentive responding can induce spurious associa.pdf,,,Social and Behavioral Sciences; Clinical Psychology; Cognitive Psychology; Judgment and Decision Making; Psychiatry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Researchers have proposed numerous useful methods for detecting carelessness in survey research, including relatively simple summary statistics such as the frequency of adjacent responses in the same category (e.g., “long-string” analysis) and outlier statistics (e.g., Mahalanobis distance). Researchers have also used methods based on item response theory (IRT) models to identify examinees whose response patterns are unexpected given item parameters. However, researchers have not fully considered the use of nonparametric IRT methods based on Mokken scale analysis (MSA) to detect carelessness in survey research. MSA is a promising framework in which to consider participant carelessness because it is well suited to contexts in which parametric IRT models may not be appropriate, while still maintaining a focus on fundamental measurement requirements. We used a real data analysis and a simulation study to examine the sensitivity of MSA indicators of response quality to examinee carelessness and compared the results to those from standalone indicators.

Numeric and graphical indicators of response quality from MSA indicators were sensitive to examinee carelessness.

Overall, the results generally indicate that several MMPI-A validity scales are useful in detecting protocols that are largely random, but all of these validity scales are more limited in detecting partially random responding that involves less than half the total item pool located in the second half of the test booklet.

The same individuals (N = 102) completed a random number generation (RNG) task in two conditions: one (a baseline condition) in which there were no instructions to produce a random sequence and a second (an ability condition) in which such instructions were administered. Two components of departures from randomness—Prepotent Associates (shorter-term violations of random responding, such as using consecutive numbers more often) and Repetition of Responses (longer-term violations of random responding by repeating the same number over intervening trials)—were quantified. Prepotent Associates in the ability condition negatively predicted fluency and flexibility. On the other hand, Repetition of Responses in the baseline condition positively predicted originality and self-reported creative achievements. Results are discussed in terms of the unique processing substrates likely to underlie different creativity outcomes, as well as the utility of modeling such processes in terms of temporal trends in thought patterning, as can be assessed in RNG tasks.

Generalizability coefficients accounting for specific-factor, transient, and random-response error ranged from .64 to .75 for the BIDR's Self-Deception Enhancement (SDE) and Impression Management (IM) subscale scores, and these values were systematically lower than corresponding alpha (.66 to .83) and 1-week test–retest (.78 to .86) coefficients. Polytomous scoring provided higher reliability than dichotomous scoring on nearly all indexes reported. Random-response (8%–17%) and specific factor error (11%–17%) exceeded transient error (3%–6%) for both subscales and scoring methods. Doubling the number of items on a single occasion provided greater improvements in generalizability (.76–.83) than aggregating scores across 2 administrations (.72–.81). Both scoring methods provided reasonably high indexes of consistency (φ coefficients ≥ .91) at cut scores on the IM scale for detecting faked responses when all sources of error were taken into account.

We report here on the memory supporting such lose-shift responding in humans, assessed using a binary choice task in which random responding is the optimal strategy. Participants exhibited little lose-shift responding when fully attending to the task, but this increased by 30%–40% in participants that performed with additional cognitive load that is known to tax executive systems. Lose-shift responding in the cognitively loaded adults persisted throughout the testing session, despite being a sub-optimal strategy, but was less likely as the time increased between reinforcement and the subsequent choice. Furthermore, children (5–9 years old) without load performed similarly to the cognitively loaded adults. This effect disappeared in older children aged 11–13 years old. These data provide evidence supporting our hypothesis that lose-shift responding is a default and reflexive strategy in the mammalian brain, likely mediated by a decaying memory trace, and is normally suppressed by executive systems. Reducing the efficacy of executive control by cognitive load (adults) or underdevelopment (children) increases its prevalence. It may therefore be an important component to consider when interpreting choice data, and may serve as an objective behavioral assay of executive function in humans that is easy to measure.

By doing regression analyses, we investigated whether self-reported seriousness and motivation are predictive of data quality, as measured using multiple indicators (i.e., nonsubstantial values, speeding, internal data consistency, nondifferentiation, response effects).

Moreover, it was examined whether self-reported seriousness differed by device group and demographic characteristics. The results show that self-reported seriousness and motivation significantly predict multiple data quality indicators. Data quality seems similar for different device users, although smartphone users showed less speeding. Demographic characteristics explain little of the variance in data quality.

We theoretically developed and tested a model integrating the effects of perceived risk in referring and affective commitment and their interactions with the referral bonus to better explain the likelihood of referring. Results largely supported our predictions. Referral bonus presence, referral bonus amount, and affective commitment positively related to likelihood of referring, while perceived risk in referring negatively related to likelihood of referring. The findings also suggest that larger referral bonuses can help offset perceived risk in referring and low affective commitment levels.

The current studies broaden the record of personality traits correlated with inattention by examining individual differences in attachment anxiety and avoidance among adults in romantic relationships. Based upon the characteristics typically exhibited by adults high on attachment avoidance, I expected an overlap between this personality trait and inattention, such that participants higher on attachment avoidance would exhibit higher levels of inattentive responding when answering self-report questions about their relationship. Two studies addressed this hypothesis using both self-report data from individuals and partner-report data from romantic couples to examine the association between a participant’s attachment avoidance and their level of inattentive responding while participating in research focusing on their romantic relationships. Self-reported attachment avoidance was associated with greater inattentive responding in both studies.

Given the longitudinal nature of the methodology and the resulting multi-level data structure, there are sample- and measurement-related issues that make ESM studies different from other methods commonly used in management research. Consequently, ESM studies have demands for reporting sample- and measurement-related information that differ from more commonly used methods. In the current paper, we review the conceptual foundations of sample and measurement issues in ESM studies and report the findings of a survey of the ESM studies to identify current reporting practices. We then offer clear, easy to implement recommendations for reporting sample- and measurement-related aspects of ESM studies.

Previous researchers have dealt with this problem by removing inattentive participants from data analyses. A better solution would be to prevent inattentive responding. Self-Determination Theory may provide an effective approach to reducing inattentive responding, specifically by attempting to promote autonomous motivation in research participants. Providing participants with personalized feedback may increase participants’ autonomous motivation, which in turn may lead to more attentive responding. Study 1 showed that participants who are interested in feedback are more attentive throughout an online survey than participants who are not interested in feedback. The next goal was to show through experimental manipulation that emphasizing the opportunity to receive personalized feedback would decrease levels of inattentive responding and increase autonomous motivation.

To address these gaps, we review the current MTurk literature and present the results of a multi-wave study of Turker labor characteristics and organizational and occupational health variable relationships. We found Turkers to be broadly distributed across the labor market, indicating MTurk is a viable option for both generalizable and understudied samples, as well as a source for targeted occupational sectors. Additionally, we found effect size magnitudes to be comparable to published benchmarks, and data displayed high levels of test-retest reliability and stability of relationships across time.

Methods: The Sexual Compulsivity Scale and the Hypersexual Behavior Inventory were completed by 2 nonclinical online community samples of cisgender women (ns = 525 and 359), cisgender men (ns = 419 and 364), and transgender or non-binary individuals (ns = 38 and 11).

Results: Results supported the factorial validity of both assessment measures: correlated 3 factor solutions were established through exploratory factor analysis of 1 sample, and confirmatory factor analysis in the second sample. Multiple group confirmatory factor analysis, conducted on the 2 combined samples, also supported the gender invariance of the 3-factor solutions. Additional basic psychometric indices of test-retest and internal consistency reliability and criterion-related (concurrent) validity conducted across the 2 online samples were supported. Clinical Implications: Common measures of hypersexuality have potential for use in its assessment, treatment, and management. Strengths & Limitations: Study strengths include: the inclusion of 2 fairly large and diverse online samples, thorough checks for insufficient effort/validity of responding, validity and reliability methodology (ie, measurement at multiple time points, obtaining behavioral indicators of sexual health), and a comprehensive set of psychometric analyses to inform conclusions regarding the external validity, reliability, and latent structure of hypersexuality measures across gender groups. Study limitations include: potential concerns related to validity and accuracy of responding owing to a reliance on self-report, the potential for selection bias, and limiting the examination of the latent structure of hypersexuality to cisgender men and women such that the results may not generalize to gender diverse populations. Conclusion: Hypersexuality is a multidimensional construct, with a common latent structure among cisgender men and women, consistency in measurement over time, and meaningful concurrent associations with behavioral criteria that have relevance for sexual health.

The reform impacted the questions, the scale used for evaluation, the anchor labels of the scale elements, and the incentives for students to fill out the survey. Our results show that the number of extreme responses increased after the reform, which can be due to the elimination of anchor labels of the middle scale points. Insufficient effort bias also increased; however, the new motivation system doubled the response rate, which helped to collect more representative sets of evaluations.

Efficacy of healthcare remedies such as functional foods and dietary supplements usually spreads by subjective word of mouth. Though regular clinical trials could be employed, it requires significant cost in time and budget. We expect crowdsourcing can be an effective and efficient alternative to the costly clinical trials to achieve objective evaluation on healthcare remedies. The blockchain technology can alleviate the problem of information quality in most of crowdsourcing systems. Properly designed reward distribution schemes can motivate voluntary participants to provide with credible information. The distributed replication of blockchains can increase the information credibility by prohibiting malicious forgery. We also utilize the Amazon cloud system to enhance availability and scalability.

Specifically, in line with the Tripartite Influence Model, we examined the indirect effect of fit ideal internalization on drunkorexia through eating disorder-related social comparison orientation and body dissatisfaction. Data were collected from two samples of women—college undergraduate students (n = 198) and women recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk (n = 324)—in order to test the model across the two groups. All participants completed the consent forms and then questionnaires via Qualtrics between March and June 2020. The results suggest that fit ideal internalization, body dissatisfaction, and eating disorder-related social comparison orientation are linked to drunkorexia. More specifically, multigroup path analyses indicated that there was an indirect effect of fit ideal internalization on drunkorexia via eating disorder-related social comparison orientation but not through body dissatisfaction. In examining the role of different types of eating disorder-related social comparison orientation (body, eating, exercise) in the model, more nuanced patterns emerged across the samples.

Unfortunately, despite its prevalence, there is currently limited research in the literature regarding the nature of workplace understaffing and its consequences. Taking a multilevel approach, this study introduces a new multidimensional conceptualization of subjective work group understaffing, comprising of manpower and expertise understaffing, and examines both its performance and well-being consequences for individual workers (Study 1) and work groups (Study 2). Results show that the relationship between work group understaffing and individual and work group emotional exhaustion is mediated through quantitative workload and role ambiguity for both levels of analysis. Work group understaffing was also related to individual job performance, but not group performance, and this relationship was mediated by role ambiguity. Results were generally similar for the 2 dimensions of understaffing. Implications for theory and research and future research directions are discussed.

Surveys can also have runtime errors: inattentive respondents can taint results. This effect is especially problematic when deploying surveys in uncontrolled settings, such as on the web or via crowdsourcing platforms. Because the results of surveys drive business decisions and inform scientific conclusions, it is crucial to make sure they are correct. We present SurveyMan, a system for designing, deploying, and automatically debugging surveys. Survey authors write their surveys in a lightweight domain-specific language aimed at end users. SurveyMan statically analyzes the survey to provide feedback to survey authors before deployment. It then compiles the survey into JavaScript and deploys it either to the web or a crowdsourcing platform. SurveyMan's dynamic analyses automatically find survey bugs, and control for the quality of responses. We evaluate SurveyMan's algorithms analytically and empirically, demonstrating its effectiveness with case studies of social science surveys conducted via Amazon's Mechanical Turk.",10/15/14,9/29/22 20:40,10/6/22 19:11,9/29/22,197–211,,,,,,SurveyMan,OOPSLA '14,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/KIKAE96I/Tosch_Berger_2014_SurveyMan.pdf,,,social science; domain specific languages; statistical debugging,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A possible explanation for these inconsistent findings is that aberrant decision-making in ASD is domain-specific, and only manifests itself in domains related to autism symptomatology. The present study examines this premise by correlating self-reported autistic traits to individuals’ intention to engage in risky behaviours, their perception of how risky these behaviours are, and the amount of benefit they expect to obtain from engaging in them; all for five separate domains of decision-making: social, ethical, recreational, health/safety, and financial. In line with the hypotheses, persons with higher autistic traits reported reduced intention to engage in risky social behaviours and increased intention to engage in risky ethical behaviours. Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between autistic traits and risk perception in the social domain, indicating that persons with higher autistic traits perceive social behaviours as riskier than do persons with lower autistic traits. Correlations between autistic traits and individuals’ intention to engage in risky recreational and financial behaviours were small, and supported the null hypothesis (as shown by Bayes Factors). Given that most studies on uncertain and risky decision-making take place in a financial context, the present results could explain previous inconsistent findings on decision-making in ASD. Therefore, future studies should also examine decision-making outside the financial realm.",2020,9/29/22 20:40,9/29/22 20:40,9/29/22 20:40,,,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/C22FB97V/De Groot_2020_Non-Clinical Autistic Traits Correlate With Social and Ethical but Not With.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I investigated the roles of attributions (i.e., effort and ability) and implicit person theory in how individuals form performance judgments and influence subsequent responses to performance. Two different pedagogical approaches have emerged in the literature as responses to student’s performance. First, strategy-oriented feedback conveys to students that performance could change in the future. Second, comfort-oriented feedback communicates to students that the teacher will aid in coming to terms with performance and emphasizing other strengths. I found that attributions for performance mediated the relationship between level of performance, and strategy and comfort-oriented feedback. Also, implicit person theory was expected to moderate the indirect effect of performance on feedback through attributions, such that those with an incremental implicit person theory (i.e., believe traits are malleable) and those with an entity theory (i.e., believe traits are static) would differ on attributions for poor performance but make similar attributions for positive performance; however, the conditional indirect effect was not supported. This work contributes to the body of literature on implicit person theory such that it is the first study in this area to my knowledge to treat performance as a continuous variable.

Recovery represents the return of personal resources to their pre-work levels and is typically conceptualized as taking place during non-work time (e.g., at night after work, weekends, holidays). It is theorized to take place through four main recovery experiences: psychological detachment from work, relaxation, mastery experiences, and control over leisure time. This study extends the literature surrounding recovery experiences to include subordinate perceptions of supervisor recovery as a potential predictor of subordinate recovery and well-being. Participants (N=252) completed three time-lagged surveys and reported their perceptions of their supervisor’s recovery (Time 1), their own recovery (Time 2), and their feelings of vigor and fatigue (Time 3). Perceived supervisor recovery was empirically distinguishable from supervisor support for recovery and provided incremental validity in predicting subordinate recovery beyond this support perception.

The current study further evaluates the psychometric properties of a measure of caregiver behaviors in relation to youths’ exposure and response to violent news. Method: Using data from caregivers (N = 350) recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk, a confirmatory factor analysis of the Caregiver Responses to Youth Media Exposure (CRYME) was performed, and factorial invariance across male and female caregivers was examined. Concurrent and discriminant validity as well as 2-week test–retest reliability were also assessed. Results: The results support a 3-factor structure that is stable across female and male caregivers, with subscales reflecting caregiver behaviors intended to reassure a child of his or her safety, limit access to violent news, and encourage safety behaviors by instilling fear of situations covered in the media. A total of 5 items were dropped to improve model fit. Concurrent validity and discriminant validity of the 3 scales were supported by differential associations with measures of family functioning, family accommodation of child anxiety, and caregiver anxiety. Test–retest reliability was acceptable for 2 of the scales. Conclusions: The revised Caregiver Responses to Youth Media Exposure (CRYME-R) is a valid and reliable measure that can be used to identify caregiver practices for regulating violent news consumption and/or buffering its impact following violent/tragic events.

Concerning personality as an antecedent of networking behaviors, prior studies have exclusively relied on trait perspectives that focus on how people feel, think, and act. Adopting a motivational perspective on personality, we enlarge this focus and argue that beyond traits predominantly tapping social content, motives shed further light on instrumental aspects of networking – or why people network. We use McClelland’s implicit motives framework of need for power (nPow), need for achievement (nAch), and need for affiliation (nAff) to examine instrumental determinants of networking. Using a facet theoretical approach to networking behaviors, we predict differential relations of these three motives with facets of (1) internal vs. external networking and (2) building, maintaining, and using contacts. We conducted an online study, in which we temporally separate measures (N = 539 employed individuals) to examine our hypotheses. Using multivariate latent regression, we show that nAch is related to networking in general. In line with theoretical differences between networking facets, we find that nAff is positively related to building contacts, whereas nPow is positively related to using internal contacts. In sum, this study shows that networking is not only driven by social factors (i.e., nAff), but instead the achievement motive is the most important driver of networking behaviors.",2018,9/29/22 20:41,9/29/22 20:41,9/29/22 20:41,,,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/S5QBB6BT/Wolff et al_2018_Implicit Motives as Determinants of Networking Behaviors.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While a large body of research has studied its antecedents and consequences, few studies have examined what victims can do to help mitigate the damage once it has occurred. Many practitioners and scholars have suggested that workers seek out humor to help them deal with the impact of stressors such as aggression, but little is known about whether humor can actually help victims deal with the psychological damage caused by aggression in the workplace. This paper presents a programmatic series of four experimental studies that examine whether and how exposure to humorous stimuli improves well-being among victims of interpersonal aggression by integrating the superiority theory of humor with Lazarus and Folkman’s transactional model of stress and coping. Study 1 (N = 84 students) showed that exposure to humor had a positive effect on well-being in a sample based in the Philippines. Consistent with theoretical prescriptions from the superiority theory of humor, this effect was mediated by increased momentary sense of power. Study 2 (N = 205 students) found the same positive effects of humor exposure on well-being in a sample based in Australia even when manipulating perpetrator power. These findings were replicated in studies 3 (N = 175 MTurk workers) and 4 (N = 235 MTurk workers) among a diverse sample of workers based in the USA.",6/1/19,9/29/22 20:41,9/29/22 20:41,9/29/22 20:41,389-402,,3,34,,J Bus Psychol,Laughter Is (Powerful) Medicine,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/ULXBDBCB/Cheng et al_2019_Laughter Is (Powerful) Medicine.pdf,,,Well-being; Humor; Sense of power; Workplace aggression,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior studies have shown that the successful use of IM relates to a number of important outcomes for employees (e.g., higher performance evaluations), but this work has tended to compare IM usage between individuals, ignoring the fact that employees likely adjust their use of IM depending on the situations they face at work on a given day. In this paper, we argue that managing impressions on a daily basis can be draining, thereby leaving employees susceptible to the temptation to engage in subsequent harmful behaviors at work. To better understand the nature and within-person consequences of IM, we examine the daily use of two supervisor-focused IM tactics—ingratiation and self-promotion—among 75 professionals in China over the course of two work weeks. Our results indicate that there is significant within-person variance in employees’ use of ingratiation and self-promotion aimed at supervisors. Moreover, our findings suggest that the use of ingratiation, but not self-promotion, depletes employees’ self-control resources. In the case of ingratiation, this depletion is positively associated with employee deviance, and the indirect effect is stronger among employees with low political skill. Overall, this research contributes to our understanding of the dynamic, within-person nature of IM, the consequences of IM for employees, and the dark side of IM for organizations.

Results indicate that, despite a general positive association between others’ friendliness and one’s state extraversion, individuals differed in the degree to which they manifested state extraversion in response to others’ friendliness, allowing us to model this individual difference as other-contingent extraversion.

Recent research on game-based assessment and training demonstrates growing interest in how individual differences affect game-based outcomes. However, there is still a lack of clarity about the variables that affect important game-based outcomes and issues with measurement approaches regarding these variables (e.g., no validation of scales). This study develops a model where video game pursuit (VGPu) is measured as an antecedent to entering the gaming cycle. We propose that VGPu-related antecedents lead to a feedback loop where engaging in the game cycle affects game-related outcomes which again affect the antecedents of re-entering the game cycle. Moreover, we validate a measure of VGPu and provide construct as well as criterion validity evidence.Methods. Within three studies (N = 716) we develop and validate the VGPu scale - a psychometrically sound measure of intentions to pursue video games. Using Amazon?s MTurk (Studies 1, 2), participants responded to the VGPu items and we conducted exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses showing that VGPu consists of a general latent VGPu factor with four subfactors (Intentional Game Play, Generalized Game Self-Efficacy, Enjoyment of Games, Prone to Game Immersion). In Study 3, students responded to the VGPu items, to items examining construct validity, and played three video games from different genres to assess criterion-related validity of game performance and game reactions.Results. Results demonstrate construct and criterion-related validity showing that VGPu correlates with other game-related scales and predicts game performance and game reactions.Discussion. The findings demonstrate the value of the VGPu scale for research and practice because pursuing video games seems to be an important variable for predicting how individuals perform and react to game-based activities. Finally, we discuss implications for future research and practice in the realm of game-based assessment and training.",2/1/20,9/29/22 20:45,9/29/22 20:45,9/29/22 20:45,55-86,,1,51,,,Video Game Pursuit (VGPu) Scale Development,,,,,,,en,,,,,SAGE Journals,,Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/SH9RQR4S/Sanchez_Langer_2020_Video Game Pursuit (VGPu) Scale Development.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite a wealth of research on both conditions in isolation, the relationship between these constructs had not been previously examined. Based on the findings of prior literature, this study hypothesized that a direct relationship exists between the constructs. It also hypothesized that supervisor support received by salespeople will have a direct effect on both SCA and burnout. Additionally, considering the reverse-buffering effects observed for perceptions of supervisor support by employees, supervisor support was also hypothesized to have a moderating effect on the relationship between SCA and burnout. Results indicated that a direct relationship exists between SCA and emotional exhaustion, positive perceptions of supervisor support and emotional exhaustion, and negative supervisor support and both SCA and emotional exhaustion. Results of the moderation analysis showed that SCA becomes less related to emotional exhaustion as negative perceptions of supervisor support increase.

Previous research has shown that this effect can be successfully modeled through the random intercept item factor analysis (RIIFA) model, as evidenced by the improvements in the model fit in comparison to models that only contain substantive factors. However, little is known regarding the capability of this model in recovering the uncontaminated person scores. To address this issue, the study analyzes the performance of the RIIFA approach across three types of wording effects proposed in the literature: carelessness, item verification difficulty, and acquiescence. In the context of unidimensional substantive models, four independent variables were manipulated, using Monte Carlo methods: type of wording effect, amount of wording effect, sample size, and test length. The results corroborated previous findings by showing that the RIIFA models were consistently able to account for the variance in the data, attaining an excellent fit regardless of the amount of bias. Conversely, the models without the RIIFA factor produced increasingly a poorer fit with greater amounts of wording effects. Surprisingly, however, the RIIFA models were not able to better estimate the uncontaminated person scores for any type of wording effect in comparison to the substantive unidimensional models. The simulation results were then corroborated with an empirical dataset, examining the relationship between learning strategies and personality with grade point average in undergraduate studies. The apparently paradoxical findings regarding the model fit and the recovery of the person scores are explained, considering the properties of the factor models examined.",2021,9/29/22 20:45,9/29/22 20:45,9/29/22 20:45,,,,12,,,Modeling Wording Effects Does Not Help in Recovering Uncontaminated Person Scores,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/NKAERMDL/Nieto et al_2021_Modeling Wording Effects Does Not Help in Recovering Uncontaminated Person.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe a decade-long research program that investigates the possibility that some people may genuinely not know their risk of even well-publicized hazards. We demonstrate that indications of not knowing (i.e., ?don?t know? responses) are prevalent in the U.S. population, are systematically more likely to occur among marginalized sociodemographic groups, and are associated with less engagement in protective health behaviors. ?Don?t know? responses are likely indications of genuinely limited knowledge and therefore may indicate populations in need of targeted intervention.

Sickle Cell Disease is an inherited chronic disorder of red blood cells requiring careful pain management. A significant number of mHealth applications have been developed in the market to help clinicians collect and monitor information of SCD patients. Surveys are the most common way to self-report patient conditions. These are non-engaging and suffer from poor compliance. The quality of data gathered from survey instruments while using technology can be questioned as patients may be motivated to complete a task but not motivated to do it well. A compromise in quality and quantity of the collected patient data hinders the clinicians' effort to be able to monitor patient's health on a regular basis and derive effective treatment measures. This research study has two goals. The first is to monitor user compliance and data quality in mHealth apps with long and repetitive surveys delivered. The second is to identify possible motivational interventions to help improve compliance and data quality. As a form of intervention, will introduce intrinsic and extrinsic motivational factors within the application and test it on a small target population. I will validate the impact of these motivational factors by performing a comparative analysis on the test results to determine improvements in user performance. This study is relevant, as it will help analyze user behavior in long and repetitive self-reporting tasks and derive measures to improve user performance. The results will assist software engineers working with doctors in designing and developing improved self-reporting mHealth applications for collecting better quality data and enhance user compliance.",,9/29/22 20:46,10/22/22 19:49,9/29/22 20:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9781369674514,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/JAVQKRBV/Rallabhandi_Monitoring and Improving User Compliance and Data Quality For Long and.pdf,,,Data quality; Compliance; Health and environmental sciences; Mhealth; User engagement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Satisficing behavior of these survey participants may reduce attention and threaten validity. To address this, the current research paradigm mandates excluding participants through filtering heuristics (e.g., time, instructional manipulation checks). Yet, both the selection of the filter and the filtering threshold are not standardized. This flexibility may lead to suboptimal filtering and potentially “p-hacking”, as researchers can pick the most “successful” filter. This research is the first to tests a comprehensive set of established and new filters against key metrics (validity, reliability, effect size, power). Additionally, we introduce a multivariate machine learning approach to identify inattentive participants. We find that while filtering heuristics require high filter levels (33% or 66% of participants), machine learning filters are often superior, especially at lower filter levels.

Drawing from social comparison theory (Festinger, 1954) and social exchange theory (Blau, 1964), I predicted that upward social comparison would lead to both pleasant reactions (inspiration, perceived gain of work resources) and unpleasant reactions (envy, perceived loss of work resources), which in turn would differentially affect knowledge sharing/hiding behaviors targeting high-performing coworkers. I further predicted that individual differences in directing behaviors toward goals (goal orientation) and task structures requiring reliance on coworkers (task interdependence) would moderate the relationships between upward social comparison and knowledge sharing/hiding behaviors. Two studies were conducted to test these ideas. In Study 1, full-time knowledge workers reflected on their coworkers who performed higher than or similar to themselves at work and recalled their feelings, thoughts, and behaviors toward the coworkers. In Study 2, undergraduate students were paired up with high- or average-performing students and performed a business simulation that required high or low interdependence with the experiment partners. Across two studies, I found a significant indirect effect of a coworker’s performance on knowledge sharing and knowledge hiding via envy. In other words, participants shared less and withheld more knowledge from high-performing coworkers than from average-performing coworkers due to feelings of envy. Goal orientation and task interdependence did not moderate such links. The current research not only advances the existing social comparison literature but also the knowledge management literature by integrating emotion into knowledge exchange behaviors.",2022,9/29/22 20:46,10/22/22 20:22,9/29/22 20:46,,,,,,,The Bright and Dark Sides of Upward Social Comparison,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798834064077,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/XH8DJTIK/Lee_2022_The Bright and Dark Sides of Upward Social Comparison.pdf,,,Envy; High performers; Inspiration; Knowledge hiding; Knowledge sharing; Social comparison,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In study 2, based on a heterogeneous sample of working adults, we demonstrate that the majority of single-item measures examined demonstrated little to no comprehension or usability concerns. Study 3 provides evidence for the reliability of the proposed single-item measures based on test–retest reliabilities across the three temporal conditions (1 day, 2 weeks, 1 month).

Minor daily events, described as hassles or uplifts, can elicit negative or positive feelings, respectively. We hypothesize that mood and daily hassles/uplifts are connected to life domain conflict and life domain enrichment over time. A sample of 229 participants completed questionnaires measuring mood, daily affective events, and life domain conflict and enrichment once per week over the course of 4 weeks, yielding 677 data points. The results of hierarchical linear modeling analysis showed that positive mood predicted life domain enrichment, and negative mood predicted both life domain enrichment and life domain conflict. Moreover, positive affective events predicted life domain enrichment and work–private life conflict. However, negative affective events only predicted work–private life enrichment. This study contributes to the existing literature by adopting a diary study perspective on the interaction of life domains and by explicitly taking mood and affective events into account as potential antecedents.

The mechanisms for PC technology adoption have yet to be defined, which inhibits its diffusion in the construction market. This study aims to reveal the intrinsic motivation and action mechanism for PC technology adoption. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on the technology acceptance model (TAM), the study integrates characteristics from the diffusion of innovation theory to propose a multifaceted model for explaining practitioners’ PC technology adoption behavior from technology, organization and environment contexts. The proposed theoretical model was empirically examined via a survey of 234 professionals in mainland China using the partial least squares-structural equation modeling technique. Findings The outcomes indicated that relative advantage, corporate social responsibility and market demand are significantly positively related to practitioners’ perceived usefulness from PC technology. Regulatory support and trading partner support have noticeable positive effects on practitioners’ perceived ease of use from PC technology. Perceived ease of use is found to positively influence perceived usefulness, and both of them have a positive influence on the attitude toward adopting PC technology. Attitude is further confirmed as an important predictor of adoption intention, which would lead to actual PC technology adoption behavior.

Although both GD and IGD reflect disordered gaming tendencies marked by excessive time spent gaming, little is known about the extent to which too much time spent gaming becomes particularly problematic. Moreover, emerging research has highlighted the need to further explore how both disordered gaming frameworks perform in the assessment and estimation of disordered gaming symptoms and related behaviors. Methods The primary aim of the present study was to shed light on the complex relationship between time spent gaming and disordered gaming and to provide prevalence estimates of disordered gaming across the WHO and APA frameworks. This study adopted an online survey methodology and a cross-sectional design in a large sample of 123,262 eligible gamers from 168 countries. Results The results obtained indicated that the prevalence rate of disordered gaming among the participants was smaller when assessed with the WHO framework (i.e., 1.96%) in comparison to the APA framework (i.e., 4.97%). Additionally, the relationship between time spent gaming and disordered gaming varied, and disordered gaming was associated on average with 34.53 h of gaming a week within the APA framework (i.e., with at least five criteria endorsed; higher gaming-time-averages for those endorsing more criteria) and an average of 40.13 h a week within the WHO framework (i.e., with all criteria endorsed). Conclusions The relationship between weekly time spent gaming and disordered gaming is multifaceted and varies according to the diagnostic framework adopted. The results highlight the need for further refinement at the diagnostic level in regard to disordered gaming.",3/1/22,9/29/22 20:46,10/6/22 19:01,9/29/22 20:46,114721,,,296,,Social Science & Medicine,The interplay between time spent gaming and disordered gaming,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/YIUP3QXG/Pontes et al_2022_The interplay between time spent gaming and disordered gaming.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/L89H264Q/S0277953622000247.html,,,American Psychiatric association; Gaming disorder; Time spent gaming; World health organization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The secondary purpose was to develop and validate an instrument for measuring college students’ physical activity awareness. Three studies were conducted sequentially using a mixed-method approach.   The first study used a phenomenological perspective to understand college students’ physical activity experience through focus group interview, concluding with four proposed domains that captures college students’ physical activity awareness including: personal physical activity level, social support, environment, and recommendation knowledge. In addition, the results indicated a lack of self-assessment in personal physical activity and awareness of physical activity recommendations.    The second study involved multiple phases for instrument development. Participants for the content validity study were 10 experts in the field of physical activity and health. Items with unacceptable agreement (i.e. < 90%) were removed and remaining items were revised based on the suggestions of the experts. The instrument was first pilot tested among 50 undergraduate students for item clarity and the feasibility of using the online survey, and then tested for reliability and construct validity in 994 college students. The results indicated acceptable to good internal consistency (alpha ranging from .74 to .92), and an excellent model fit.   The third study measured college students’ physical activity awareness, knowledge of physical activity recommendation, and self-reported physical activity using the validated instrument in study II and explored the relationships among these variables. Effects of gender, ethnicity, major and class standing on physical activity awareness were also examined. The results suggested college students had slightly moderate levels of PA awareness in the four components (ranging from 4.21 to 5.24 out of 7), and seemly overestimated activity levels. It was found that awareness was positively associated with knowledge (r = .220, p < .01) and behavior (r = .325, p < .01), however, no significant correlations were found between knowledge and behavior. Significant major effects were found in awareness, knowledge and behavior, suggesting the role of education in raising physical activity awareness and fostering physically active lifestyles. The path analysis results also confirmed significant direct effects from all the four physical activity awareness components on total physical activity level, providing future directions for physical activity promotion in higher education settings.",8/17/18,9/29/22 20:51,10/22/22 20:32,9/29/22 20:51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,repositories.lib.utexas.edu,,Accepted: 2018-10-18T16:08:32Z DOI: 10.15781/T2T14V809,,"/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/MC6KHGIZ/Shangguan_2018_Physical activity awareness, knowledge, and behavior in college students.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/YQQA8YGC/69021.html",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several factors, including drinking motives and impulsivity, have been studied to better understand college drinking behaviors. Research has identified that coping motives (i.e., drinking to reduce negative affect) and negative urgency (i.e., the tendency for rash reaction in response to negative affect) are both closely linked to alcohol-related problems and to one another. The primary purpose of this study was to test if mindfulness skills moderate the relation between negative urgency and drinking to cope. To test for moderation, 683 college student drinkers responded to self-report measures of drinking behaviors, drinking motives, impulsivity, and daily utilization of mindfulness skills. Four separate regression models tested for the mindfulness skills of observing, describing, acting with awareness, and accepting without judgment as potential moderators to the relation between negative urgency and coping motives. The mindfulness skill of accepting without judgment significantly moderated (i.e., dampened) the positive relation between negative urgency and drinking to cope. Results may be useful in developing targeted intervention and prevention efforts to test among students, as skills training may benefit individuals with long-standing impulsive personality traits who engage in the traditionally problematic behavior of drinking to cope.",2/1/20,9/29/22 20:52,10/6/22 19:09,9/29/22 20:51,106135,,,101,,Addictive Behaviors,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,"/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/FSFDAD8A/Hoyer_Correia_2020_Relations among motives, negative urgency, and mindfulness skills in college.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/VDW5XIEY/S0306460319307907.html",,,Mindfulness; Motives; Negative urgency; Impulsivity; Drinking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From approximately 1995-2015, overdose deaths involving BZDs quadrupled and average dose equivalents more than tripled. Specific concern has centered on elevated rates of BZD use among individuals with chronic pain, given that BZDs are generally not indicated for pain management. Consistent with negative reinforcement and motivational models of substance use, desire for pain alleviation may be a salient motivator of BZD use, particularly as individuals commonly report using BZDs for negative affect alleviation. The present study tested cross-sectional associations between pain intensity and clinically relevant BZD use patterns among individuals with chronic pain. We also examined the role of pain catastrophizing, a malleable transdiagnostic factor reflecting negative cognitive-affective pain responses. Participants were 306 adults (Mage = 38.7, 38.9% female) with chronic musculoskeletal pain and a current BZD prescription who completed an online survey study via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Hierarchical linear regression results indicated that pain intensity was positively associated with past-month BZD use frequency and BZD dependence severity. Logistic regression results indicated that greater pain intensity was associated with a 1.2 times greater likelihood of endorsing BZD misuse behaviors. Pain catastrophizing was positively associated with BZD dependence severity and likelihood of BZD misuse, after accounting for pain intensity. Initial findings implicate pain/pain-related cognitive-affective processes in higher-risk BZD use, and suggest pain relief is a common, yet underrecognized, self-reported motivation for taking BZDs. Future research should examine mechanisms underlying pain-BZD covariation and co-use behaviors.",2021,9/29/22 20:52,10/22/22 20:05,9/29/22 20:52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798762193986,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/MVHGRB69/Lape_2021_Benzodiazepine Use and Dependence in Relation to Chronic Pain Intensity and.pdf,,,Behavioral health; Benzodiazepines; Chronic pain; Prescription drug misuse; Substance use,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Findings With the first two samples, we derived an initial three-dimensional version of the Coachability Scale and provided evidence of convergent validity. With Samples 3 and 4, we expanded the scale with additional dimensions related to coaching feedback processes and accumulated additional evidence of the scale's validity, and provided evidence of convergence between the two versions of the Coachability Scale. Research limitations/implications We encourage continued research on the Coachability Scale, as well as research on coachability in formal coaching relationships and with more diverse populations and cultures.

In two studies, we investigated the comparability and possible integrative approaches for the two perspectives, including different versions of existing measurement instruments. Our results, based on two large samples of employees stemming from diverse backgrounds and countries (N₁ = 295, N₂ = 557), indicate distinct differences in terms of the internal structure of existing job crafting measures and with regard to theoretically anticipated relationships between subdimensions. A first empirical attempt to integrate both perspectives provided promising results for overarching approach/avoidance as well as targets of crafting factors.

Created relying on Petri Nets theory and aiming to represent discrete time events, Colored Petri Nets (CPNs) are a graphical formal language developed and widely employed for system modeling. While traditional CPNs only have elements with ordinary stylization and behaviors, in this article we explore the key ideas behind Web Interaction Modeling Using Colored Petri Nets (wiCPN), a modeling style developed with focus on representing Web interactions as an incremental improvement of CPNs. We review wiCPN’s refinements over CPNs and the modeling of the Web interface of Classroom eXperience (CX), a ubiquitous educational platform, thus verifying the model’s properties to ensure it was able to represent the different access levels among its users and how wiCPN displayed suitability to comprehend this requirement on the generated model. We have also improved the originally developed model with the modification of elements to make it finite and fully analyzable. Also, we added temporization capabilities to the model and ran corresponding user simulation to observe the average time that users with different roles tend to spend during interactions. We compared wiCPN results with Unified Modeling Language (UML) Activity and Use Case diagrams, observing, as outcomes, that the generated model represented CX’s interactive flow correctly and maintained a concise notation—a single wiCPN diagram was sufficient to depict the same interactive flow that, in UML, would require several diagrams, something that could overload the design team in actual software development scenarios. We also included new user experiments comprising qualitative results from experts.

While there is not universal consensus on the definition of calling, the current study takes the more popular modern, multidimensional approach, which consists of three elements: (1) it is experienced through external transcendent summons, (2) it holds a higher purpose of meaning, and (3) directly, or indirectly, serves a prosocial purpose. Research to date has touched on calling as it relates to spirituality, wellness outcomes, life satisfaction, and work outcomes. The purpose of this study is to better understand the relationship between calling and the work outcomes of engagement, job satisfaction, and turnover intent. The present study consisted of a sample of 227 participants recruited through the Amazon Mechanical Turk Service (MTurk). Participants were required to be 25 years or older, be employed full or part-time, and reside in the United States. Participants completed an online survey that included measures of search for calling, presence of calling, living a calling, engagement, general job satisfaction, intrinsic job satisfaction, extrinsic job satisfaction, turnover intent, and demographic variables. Correlations and correlation comparisons were used to explore relationships between the ways respondents experience calling and work outcomes. The results of the study indicated positive relationships between presence of a calling and living a calling with engagement, job satisfaction, intrinsic job satisfaction, extrinsic job satisfaction, and negative relationships with turnover intent. The results also indicated a positive relationship with search for calling and turnover intent, but no other outcome variables. This relationship was also not as strong as with presence of a calling and living a calling. Further, though both living a calling and presence of a calling were both significantly negatively related to turnover intent, the relationship was significantly more negative for living a calling. The findings in this study may help inform organizations and career counselors of ways to best utilize the understanding of calling in attracting and retaining employees, improving engagement, and reducing turnover.",,9/29/22 20:52,10/22/22 19:48,9/29/22 20:52,,,,,,,Calling at Work,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9780438726925,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/DQ3YZ6WJ/Yama_Calling at Work.pdf,,,Psychology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, research topics that rely heavily on analysis of text data, such as autobiographical memory, have lacked methods of detecting invalid texts that are both effective and practical. Although researchers have suggested many data quality indicators that might identify invalid responses (e.g., response time, character/word count), few of these methods have been empirically validated with text responses. In the current study, we propose and implement a supervised machine learning approach that can mimic the accuracy of human coding, but without the need to hand-code entire text datasets. Our approach (a) trains, validates, and tests on a subset of texts manually labelled as valid or invalid, (b) calculates performance metrics to help select the best model, and (c) predicts whether unlabelled texts are valid or invalid based on the text alone. Model validation and evaluation using autobiographical memory texts indicated that machine learning accurately detected invalid texts with performance near human coding, significantly outperforming existing data quality indicators.

Specifically, this study investigated the effects of value levels and value congruence on commitment, while differentiating between seven value dimensions and between perceived values from and commitment to the organization, supervisor, and team as separate targets. This differentiated approach provides more extensive insights into relationships between values and commitment by demonstrating consistencies and differences across targets and value dimensions. Data from a cross-organizational sample of 1000 employees were analyzed using polynomial regressions with response surface analyses. Results showed that perceived target values most consistently demonstrated strong effects on commitment to that target. Their effects were mostly independent of employee values. Value congruence only contributed to commitment for values concerning performance expectations toward employees. Across targets, people-centered values were most strongly linked to commitment. Accordingly, perceived values of commitment targets, and especially people-centered values, seem to play the key role in value–commitment associations, whereas value congruence has limited practical relevance for commitment. Therefore, practitioners should foster strongly perceived positive values, especially people-centered values, from key commitment targets within organizations, rather than aim for value congruence. This study advances the debate on value congruence’s role for commitment by showing that congruence effects are restricted to certain values, whereas perceived target values are consistently linked to commitment, hence recommending a shift of focus in value–commitment research.",4/1/19,9/29/22 20:52,9/29/22 20:52,9/29/22 20:52,169-187,,2,34,,J Bus Psychol,Do Values and Value Congruence Both Predict Commitment?,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/QMUENVR6/Seggewiss et al_2019_Do Values and Value Congruence Both Predict Commitment.pdf,,,Employee commitment; Employee values; Organizational commitment; Organizational values; Person–group fit; Person–organization fit; Person–supervisor fit; Supervisor commitment; Team commitment; Value congruence; Value fit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, six multidimensional scales were constructed respectively for measuring efficiency-, finality-, fairness-, strictness-, accuracy-, and transparency-oriented confidence. Despite more complexity of factor structures than originally expected, results of psychometric evaluation six scales of confidence can be used as a reliable and valid tool for measuring different aspects of confidence. Study 2 involves a test of predictive ability of the scale scores for two types of law related behaviors–cooperation and verdict–based on a second sample of 433 US adults from MTurk. This study finds that people with greater confidence in the system’s accurate fact-finding and fair treatment are more willing to help institutions, and people with greater confidence in the system’s conformity with the formal structure of law are more compliant with the law. Results show that higher accuracy- and lower strictness-oriented confidence are related to greater guilty verdicts, mainly through preexisting belief in high probability of commission for the defendant. Higher efficiency-oriented confidence is related to greater guilty verdicts, mainly through less stringent reasonable doubt standard.

Integrating social comparison theory and EASI theory, we contend that lower LMX social comparison (LMXSC) is associated with positive (self-improving) and negative (undermining) behavior via different emotional mechanisms and that the focal employee's perceptions of the comparison coworker's pride play a critical role in qualifying the effects of lower LMXSC. The results from a time-lagged field study and an online experiment reveal that lower LMXSC is associated with both benign and malicious envy, which in turn respectively relate to the focal employee learning and socially undermining the superior coworker. The negative indirect effect of LMXSC on learning behaviors via benign envy is stronger when the coworker compared is perceived to be higher (vs. lower) in authentic pride, whereas the indirect effect of LMXSC on social undermining via malicious envy is stronger when the coworker compared is perceived to be higher (vs. lower) in hubristic pride.

Belief formation is broken into two distinct phases. Third-person opportunity beliefs (i.e., an opportunity for someone) form as a result of the opportunity recognition phase. First-person opportunity beliefs (i.e., an opportunity for me) form as a result of the opportunity evaluation phase. Although there is consensus that belief formation follows the path of opportunity recognition phase to the opportunity evaluation phase, most of the theoretical and empirical work to date has examined these phases independently. Herein, I review the opportunity recognition and opportunity evaluation research to synthesize a congruence model of belief formation. Specifically, I introduce the concepts of goal congruence, capability congruence, circumstance congruence, and identity congruence to explain why some individuals transition from favorable third-person opportunity beliefs to (un)favorable first-person opportunity beliefs, while others do not. I test hypotheses with a sample of 172 nascent and experienced entrepreneurs across two time points. Results support that capability, goal, and circumstance congruence moderate the relationship between third-person beliefs and first-person opportunity evaluations.

We explore how formality influences engagement, measured by attention, dropout, time spent on the study and participant performance, in an online study with 369 participants on Mechanical Turk (paid) and LabintheWild (volunteer). Formal language improves participant attention compared to using casual language in both paid and volunteer conditions, but does not affect dropout, time spent, or participant performance.

The current study uses structural equation modeling to test whether the theory of Purposeful Work Behavior explains how personality leads to Work Engagement. It was found that, as a group, three job characteristics (Task Identity, Feedback from Work, and Feedback from Others) and Achievement Striving mediate the relationship between Conscientiousness and experienced Meaningfulness, which subsequently predicts Work Engagement. Neuroticism was found to predict Achievement Striving, experienced Meaningfulness, and Work Engagement, but none of the job characteristics. The hypothesis that the three job characteristics would moderate the relationship between Achievement Striving and experienced Meaningfulness was not supported. Overall, the theory of Purposeful Work Behavior was mostly supported with regards to Conscientiousness but not for Neuroticism.

A significant portion of extant research examining these relationships have looked at possible environmental and individual factors that act as buffers, weakening the relationship between demands at work and subsequent negative outcomes. Many of these studies have focused on the personal and contextual variables that minimize the negative impact of job demands on employee psychological need satisfaction specifically. While the feedback environment provided by supervisors has been extensively tied to positive organizational and individual outcomes, to date the supervisor feedback environment has not been examined as a possible buffer between job demands and subsequent negative organizational and individual outcomes. Importantly, the majority of extant feedback environment literature has looked at the ways in which the feedback environment directly reduces or prevents job demands rather than how the feedback environment may be altering existing relationships between job demands and psychological need satisfaction, burnout, or turnover intentions. The current study seeks to explore, for the first time, the ways in which the feedback environment and an individual’s receptivity to it may change the negative relationship between job demands and these outcomes. Respondents to an online survey from across industries and job types were used to investigate hypotheses in the present study at multiple time points. Ultimately, results suggest that while the supervisor feedback environment is not lessening or negating the impact of job demands on psychological need satisfaction (and subsequently burnout and turnover intentions), supervisors can still impact employee well-being through the maintenance of a high-quality feedback environment, as employees with strong supervisor feedback environments are able to sustain strong psychological need satisfaction and low levels of burnout despite significant job demands.",,9/29/22 20:52,10/22/22 19:56,9/29/22 20:52,,,,,,,The Buffering Effect of the Feedback Environment,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798662504349,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/DZGRCXGN/Pears_The Buffering Effect of the Feedback Environment.pdf,,,Feedback; Burnout; Turnover intentions; Feedback environment; Feedback orientation; Turnover,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Definitions for the construct vary from self-confidence about one’s career, to optimistic outlook, to engagement with career exploration and commitment tasks relevant to adolescence and early adulthood. The theoretical basis, and measurement of, vocational identity development overlaps with that of career adaptability; the purpose of study 1a was cross-theoretical dimension reduction, to explore underlying factors of the two constructs. Exploratory factor analysis of subscales of career adaptability and vocational identity development measures (Career Adapt-Abilities Scale-USA, Career Futures Inventory-Revised, Career Salience Scale, Utrecht Management of Identity Commitments Scale, and Vocational Identity Status Assessment) yielded a three factor solution, which was found superior to competing models in a subsequent confirmatory factor analysis. The three factors were Doubtless Commitment, In-Depth Exploration, and Personal Agency. Study 1b sought to explore how career adaptability and vocational identity development factors change over the years of college, and across different vocational interests. Factor scores of the above factors were computed for all participants. Doubtless Commitment and In-Depth Exploration were not significantly related to year in school, but vocational interests were significantly related to all factors. Vocational interests were also explored as moderators to the relationship between year in school and In-Depth Exploration and Doubtless Commitment.

Positive marginality describes the perception that belonging to a non-dominant cultural or demographic group can be advantageous rather than oppressing. To date, research on positive marginality has explored the construct in a qualitative manner across a number of demographic groups (e.g., Jewish women in social sciences, African American women in predominantly Caucasian workplaces). Because women are largely underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, the current research examined positive marginality in a STEM context. This research advances the existing understanding of positive marginality through two studies. Study 1 tested the psychometric properties of a new measure of positive marginality. A qualitative pilot study informed the generation of a measure of positive marginality which was administered to a sample of 105 sophomore and junior STEM majors (Study 1A) and a sample of 433 women working in STEM occupations (Study 1B). Exploratory factor analyses were conducted in Study 1A and 1B as well as a confirmatory factor analysis in Study 1B to test a hypothesized 3-factor structure of positive marginality. Results of Study 1 supported a single-factor structure of positive marginality. Study 2 identified and assessed a partial nomological network of the unidimensional construct among women working in STEM occupations. Specifically, a sample of 313 women working in STEM occupations were surveyed at two time points on hypothesized antecedents and outcomes of positive marginality. Structural equation modeling suggested support for core self-evaluations, need for achievement, and domain identification as antecedents of positive marginality; career satisfaction and persistence intentions were supported as outcomes of positive marginality for women in STEM. Together, these studies provide support for the relevance of positive marginality to women pursuing STEM careers and demonstrate the relationship between positive marginality and individual differences and career outcomes.

Employees from various work sectors (N = 183) responded to online surveys about their weekend.

Using the Jobs Demands-Resources (JD-R) model, this study also examines the indirect effect of PsyCap on performance through the mediating role of career engagement. Participants were full-time employees from various public service organizations in Indonesia (e.g., schools). The study was advertised mainly via alumni network groups. After a three-phase data collection, 265 participants fully completed the study. The data were collected using Psychological Capital Questionnaire (PCQ), Career Engagement Scale (CES), and Individual Performance Scale (IPS) and analyzed using a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique. This study found the positive effect of PsyCap on employees’ career engagement and performance. Career engagement positively mediated the indirect effect of PsyCap on employees’ performance. Drawing from the JD-R model and the work engagement perspective, this study postulated that PsyCap provided significant personal resources to help employees cope with demanding career-related activities. While employees engaged in career advancement activities, they also improved their performance. PsyCap provided the employees with psychological resources (e.g., self-efficacy) which were fruitful for their career engagement and performance.

Using a daily diary methodology to track velocity, affect, and resource allocation toward two employee-defined goals over the course of one work week, I examine the effect of velocity on affective states, and in turn the impact of affect on resource allocation across multiple goals. Consistent with extant theory, results suggest that when velocity moving toward a goal is faster (slower) than desired, this results in positive (negative) affect, which is associated with decreased (increased) time allocated to the goal in question. In other words, individuals who reduce the perceived discrepancy between their current and desired state at a rate that is faster than expected feel positively about this progress and “coast” by decreasing effort allocation toward that goal. Contrary to my hypothesis, resource allocation toward one goal was not negatively associated with resource allocation toward a competing goal. Given that affect is theorized to play a central role in goal pursuit, I also integrated affect spin, an individual difference in the experience of diverse affective states, into the hypothesized model. Results suggest affect spin moderates the relationship between velocity and affect, with this relationship being stronger for those higher in affect spin. The present study contributes to the current body of literature by specifically invoking multiple goal pursuit processes, employing a seldom-used but theoretically consistent measure of velocity, and testing hypotheses within-person.",2021,9/29/22 20:53,10/22/22 20:14,9/29/22 20:53,,,,,,,Coasting in the Pursuit of Multiple Goals,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798516912894,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/IFBL3RVV/Whitaker Sorge_2021_Coasting in the Pursuit of Multiple Goals.pdf,,,Control theory; Affect; Affect spin; Coasting; Resource allocation; Velocity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we developed a theoretical model that explains the determinants of rural smartness and its subsequent consequences on rural economic welfare. We validated the model with survey data from 179 villages in West Java Province, Indonesia. The results suggest that rural smartness is determined by the interplay of organizational, environmental, and technological readiness, and has a strong positive impact on innovativeness which, in turn, improves the competitiveness of the rural business ecosystem.

We test this possibility by studying willingness to recommend, which captures a willingness to serve as a professional reference for a colleague. Based on signaling theory, we hypothesized that colleague incivility is negatively related to willingness to recommend, but this relationship is moderated by colleague in-role performance and job-level factors. In study 1, multilevel modeling of multisource data revealed that colleague incivility negatively related to willingness to recommend, but troublingly, this relationship was weaker among colleagues who were high rather than low performers, regardless of job-level moderators. In study 2, we tested whether organizations can intervene and encourage potential reference providers to pay greater attention to incivility. Regression results showed that providers placed greater weight on their colleague’s incivility in relation to willingness to recommend when signals were sent that the hiring organization was unwilling to sacrifice civility for top performance.

A considerable amount of empirical research has demonstrated experts are critically important for identifying variables and measures on which to collect data. Research has also shown that once experts identify variables and measures, a statistical combination of quantitative data (e.g., a simple sum or linear regression) is consistently superior to the judgments of a single expert. Remarkably, this conclusion is reached across a very diverse range of phenomena relevant to organizations, such as employee performance, training effectiveness, managerial success, achievement in school, and physical and psychological health (Dawes, Faust, & Meehl, 1989; Grove, Zald, Lebow, Snitz, & Nelson, 2000; Ostroff, 1991). The false belief that expert judgments trump algorithms is a stubborn one, for example in personnel selection practice (Highhouse, 2008).

Financial worry and rumination can have serious psychological consequences, resulting in lower psychological well-being, mental-health problems, and impaired cognitive functioning. The literature lacks studies investigating the socio-demographic antecedents of and the financial processes underlying financial worry and rumination. The purpose of our study was to investigate the socio-demographic and financial antecedents of financial worry and rumination (FWR) and the financial factors mediating these relationships. We collected online self-administered survey data from a sample of the Dutch population (N = 1040). Using confirmatory factor analysis, we found that a bifactor model, including a strong and reliable general factor, provided the best explanation of the structure underlying FWR. We developed a parallel mediation model and investigated its structural relationships using structural equation modeling. After controlling for multiple hypotheses testing, our results show that income, past positive changes in one’s finances, and age are negatively related to FWR. We found no support for education level and only weak support for expected changes in one’s finances as antecedents. Furthermore, the explained variance in FWR substantially improved after adding the mediators of making ends meet, financial buffer, and perceived debts. Among these mediators, making ends meet played a key role explaining respectively half and two-thirds of the total effects of income and past changes in one’s finances on FWR.

The current study tested whether mindful individuals,  specifically mindful leaders, impact the work experience of their direct reports.  Building on initial evidence (Leroy et al., 2015; Nubold, Quaquebeke, &  Hulsheger, 2019) and strong theoretical ties (Kernis, 2002), supervisor mindfulness  was a significant predictor of direct reports’ perception of authentic leadership  behavior. Empathy was tested as a positive other-directed emotion that drives the  perceptions of authentic behavior. Direct reports’ perceptions of supervisor  empathy displayed a significant relationship, whereas supervisors self-rated  empathy did not, suggesting it is the display of empathic concern that is important  to direct reports’ ratings of authentic leader behavior rather than leaders’ selfperceptions of empathy. While positive interpersonal outcomes of mindful and authentic leaders have been theorized (Reb et al., 2015), impacts to coaching and  the feedback environment had yet to be tested.

Our research argues that in this case consumers may be motivated to alternate between services to increase utility, rather than completely replace one service by the other. Previous research has focused on technology adoption, technology usage continuity, and switching to a new technology. However, alternating between technologies remains unexplored. Grounded on motivation theory, our proposed research model synthesizes the contributions from fields like psychology and marketing to find potential antecedents to user alternating behavior of technologies: OSL, ASL, variety seeking, intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, and product characteristics. We will conduct a survey among USA users to gather data about these variables and validate their significant impact on alternating behavior of technologies. A pilot test will be conduct to refine our measurement items, whereas the full sample will be assessed in terms of reliability, validity, and explanation power. The results are expected to validate our model for explaining this relatively new behavior in the use of technologies, whereas they could suggest managers which strategies they can focus on to remain competitive in the market and co-exist with other technologies offering similar services.",2017,9/29/22 21:05,10/14/22 1:13,9/29/22 21:05,,,,,,IIS,VARIETY SEEKING,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/YXDYDUZD/2017 - VARIETY SEEKING CONCEPTUAL MODEL IN INFORMATION T.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 220 subjects participated in this study. Specifically, this study revealed how social dominance orientation, ambivalent sexism and gender discrimination perceptions toward women affect a third-party observer’s recognition of gender microaggressions perpetrated against women. In addition, this study examined the effect of role congruence on the propensity to recognize gender microaggressions. Role congruence stems from role congruity theory which posits that a woman in a leadership or masculine role will receive positive or negative evaluations based on the degree to which she conforms to her gender stereotype. The results demonstrated significant negative correlations between SDO, hostile sexism, benevolent sexism, and the recognition of gender microaggressions. Gender discrimination perceptions were also positively correlated with recognition of gender microaggressions. Results however did not support the prediction that males and females differ in the recognition of gender microaggressions. In that same vein, role congruity did not significantly interact with the independent variables as expected. Reasons for the support or lack thereof of hypotheses are discussed as well as results of additional analyses. Implications for research and practice are also discussed along with some suggestions for future studies.",,9/29/22 21:05,10/22/22 17:14,9/29/22 21:05,,,,,,,Recognition of Gender Microaggressions in the Workplace,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798569914067,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/2CR93XD2/Ako-Brew_Recognition of Gender Microaggressions in the Workplace.pdf,,,Gender discrimination; Ambivalent sexism; Microaggressions; Role congruity; Social dominance orientation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many people believe that a person’s body size is a direct result of their behaviors related to food and exercise, dismissing the impact of other factors that influence body size (e.g. genetics) (Chrisler & Barney, 2017). It is common for people to view food as “good” or “bad” based on how the food is thought to impact a person’s body. “Bad” foods cause weight gain, while “good” foods result in weight loss or maintenance (Vartanian, Herman, & Polivy, 2007). Research demonstrates that women tend to experience negative moral emotions such as guilt and shame after eating foods society characterizes as “bad” or after eating more than they view as acceptable (Sheikh, Botindari, & White, 2013). Along with health and morality, dieting and thinness holds significance in the area of social status. Thinness persists as the ideal body type in the U.S. and dieting offers a path to achieve that socially prized body type. Dieting and health, moralization of food and bodies, and dieting and status are three aspects of diet-culture. This study sought to examine how women experience diet-culture and create a tool to measure women’s diet-culture beliefs. I consulted previous literature and conducted focus groups investigating women’s experiences with diet-culture. The focus groups revealed important themes related to diet-culture that were subsequently used to generate items for the Diet-Culture Beliefs Scale (DCBS). DCBS items were administered to a sample of psychology students (n = 517) who identified as women. I conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and a parallel analysis, which both pointed to a three-factor structure for the DCBS. I then conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) specifying three factors and selected items based on psychometric quality. After modifications, analyses suggested a good model fit for the nine-item, three-factor scale. This scale is a useful first step in empirically measuring diet-culture, though additional research must be conducted to further validate the DCBS.",2020,9/29/22 21:05,10/22/22 20:22,9/29/22 21:05,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798617054592 Publication Title: ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/XHSLGBIP/Davidson_2020_The Development of a Scale to Measure Diet-Culture Beliefs.pdf,,,Women; Diet-culture; Disordered eating; Eating disorder; Scale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We extend situational strength theory by contending that, when a strong situation blocks one outlet for poor performance (e.g., low task performance), employees predisposed toward such behavior experience negative affect. They then displace their negative behavior to a second outlet (e.g., counterproductive work behavior), thereby strengthening their predispositions, unless that second outlet, too, is blocked by a strong situation. We then test this assertion using a two-wave survey (N = 369), analyzed using dual-stage moderated mediation. Results indicate strong support for this assertion vis-à-vis the personality traits of conscientiousness and agreeableness, thereby replicating and extending Meyer et al.’s (Journal of Management, 40, 1010–1041, 2014) seemingly anomalous results.

Multidimensionality included three engagement dimensions: behavioral, cognitive, and emotional (Fredricks et al., 2004). Instructional specificity included four instruction types: lecture, whole-class interaction, individual work, and group work. The study design had several phases. First, I reviewed the literature and conducted exploratory interviews to inform item writing. Then, an iterative cycle of pretesting via cognitive interviews, evaluating via expert reviews, and revising was implemented. Finally, the instrument was field-tested. Results provided initial validity evidence for combining multidimensionality and instructional specificity in engagement measurement. Yet, changes to the instrument’s internal structure occurred. First, among behaviors in whole-class interaction, active behaviors separated out from passive behaviors. Second, excluding active behaviors in whole-class interaction, behavioral and cognitive engagement dimensions were not differentiated empirically and, therefore, were collapsed. Thus, the final version of the instrument measures nine multidimensional, instruction-specific engagement constructs. Additionally, I found that student engagement may be better conceptualized as a formative construct rather than a reflective construct. The instrument is designed to enable educators to identify how and where students are not engaged. This information would allow educators to develop more targeted and, therefore, more efficient interventions. The instrument is also designed to be used in research that aims to inform the development of such interventions. In particular, it will enable researchers to determine which instructional factors affect specific types of engagement and how these factors exert their influence.",,9/29/22 21:05,10/22/22 20:20,9/29/22 21:05,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798672194141,,"/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/VTEA9SAJ/Gerasimova_Development and Validation of an Instrument to Measure Multidimensional,.pdf",,,Mathematics; Measurement; Instrument Development; Student Engagement; Undergraduate Education; Validation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study among young Dutch adults aimed to describe their perceptions on the influence of life course transitions on meat consumption, barriers and enablers to reduce meat consumption, and strategies for reducing meat consumption. Barriers and enablers were grouped applying the COM-B model that includes capability, opportunity, and motivation. This quantitative cross-sectional study included a representative sample of 1806 young adults from two Dutch consumer panels who completed an online survey. Young adults frequently reported life course transitions, especially those related to moving house, to have decreased their meat consumption. Barriers and enablers to reduce meat consumption were identified for all three factors of the COM-B model. Important barriers included taste, perceived high prices of meat alternatives, and habits. In contrast, important enablers included care for the environment and animal welfare, enjoyment of smaller portions of meat and saving money. However, barriers and enablers largely differed by groups of meat consumption frequency. Self-perceived effective strategies for reducing meat consumption were price reduction of meat alternatives, recipes for vegetarian meals, and more attractive meat alternatives.

Acquiescence is considered particularly common among young respondents and has been recognized as a source of systematic response error. Within a structural equation modeling framework, we examined whether student ratings of teaching quality provided by two age cohorts (fifth- and eighth-grade students) were affected by acquiescence, while additionally controlling for an extreme response style. Across both age cohorts, acquiescence had the highest and most consistent effects on student ratings of teaching quality, whereas extreme responding affected only ratings by fifth-grade students and to a smaller degree. Mean differences in teaching quality ratings between fifth- and eighth- grade students were partly explained by age-related differences in acquiescence. Overall, the effects of acquiescence on student ratings were rather small and primarily affected the ratings provided by younger students (i.e., fifth graders).",3/1/21,9/29/22 21:05,10/6/22 19:10,9/29/22 21:05,100937,,,68,,Studies in Educational Evaluation,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,"/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/DNEZPMBB/Marder et al_2021_Ask me, I (Dis)agree.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/9LGWT2EQ/S0191491X20301851.html",,,Acquiescence; Extreme responding; Student ratings; Teaching quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The phenomenon is attributable to the increased dependency on business information processing through vast interconnected systems that bring together internal and external information handlers and users. Traditionally technical tools have been implemented to counter information security threats. Increasingly the role of people in helping organisations defend themselves against security incidents is being acknowledged. Research on human behaviour in information security has yielded largely mixed results leading to calls for investigation of the role culture in information security. The study investigated Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) factors that influence organisational insiders' desire to adopt recommended information security measures. It also investigated the effect of individualism-collectivism on security behaviour.  A quantitative analysis of response data from 203 respondents drawn mainly from South Africa was analysed to investigate the relationships. The results indicate that together with the level of individualism-collectivism, variables from PMT are important factors in employees' security implementation decisions. By operationalising individualism-collectivism at an individual level, the study offers better generalisation of findings between studies and contexts. The study offers recommendations on how businesses can build their employees' behaviour to assist in achieving information security objectives and protect the information assets of the organisation",2018,9/29/22 21:05,10/22/22 20:12,9/29/22 21:05,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,"© 2019 University of Pretoria.

Traditional approaches to personality assessment usually ask users to answer a long list of questions and are thus not practical in many online systems.

This article reports a controlled study to investigate common mouse operations as a potential new type of data source for online personality assessment. We establish an elaborate personality-mouse behavior dataset from 146 subjects and propose kinematic and adjustment features to characterize mouse motion patterns. Statistical approaches and machine learning algorithms are employed to examine the connections between personality preferences and mouse motion features via correlation analysis, discernibility analysis, and personality recognition experiments. The results reveal some interesting expressions of cognitive personality perspectives reflected in mouse motion patterns, such as fast starting acceleration and better controller. Performance evaluation shows it is possible to recognize different personality preferences using mouse motion features with accuracies ranging from 60.6 to 78.3 percent.

Objective: We aimed to study HIE adoption using a trust-centered model. Based on the Theory of Reasoned Action, the technology adoption literature, and the trust transfer mechanism, we theoretically explained and empirically tested the impacts of the perceived transparency of privacy policy and trust in health care providers on cognitive and emotional trust in an HIE. Moreover, we analyzed the effects of cognitive and emotional trust on the intention to opt in to the HIE and willingness to disclose health information. Methods: A Web-based survey was conducted using data from a sample of 493 individuals who were aware of the HIE through experiences with a (or multiple) provider(s) participating in an HIE network. Results: Structural Equation Modeling analysis results provided empirical support for the proposed model. Our findings indicated that when patients trust in health care providers, and they are aware of HIE security measures, HIE sharing procedures, and privacy terms, they feel more in control, more assured, and less at risk. Moreover, trust in providers has a significant moderating effect on building trust in HIE efforts (P&lt;.05). Results also showed that patient trust in HIE may take the forms of opt-in intentions to HIE and patients’ willingness to disclose health information that are exchanged through the HIE (P&lt;.001). Conclusions: The results of this research should be of interest to both academics and practitioners. The findings provide an in-depth dimension of the HIE privacy policy that should be addressed by the health care organizations to exchange personal health information in a secure and private manner. This study can contribute to trust transfer theory and enrich the literature on HIE efforts. Primary and secondary care providers can also identify how to leverage the benefit of patients’ trust and trust transfer process to promote HIE initiatives nationwide.",11/26/19,9/29/22 21:05,9/29/22 21:05,9/29/22 21:05,e14050,,4,7,,,The Impacts of the Perceived Transparency of Privacy Policies and Trust in Providers for Building Trust in Health Information Exchange,,,,,,,EN,"This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work, first published JMIR Medical Informatics, is properly cited.

One has postulated three aspects of trustworthiness as state-based antecedents to trust. Another has been interpreted to comprise two aspects of trustworthiness. Empirical data shows support for both models, and debate remains as to the theoretical and practical reasons researchers may adopt one model over the other. The present research aimed to consider this debate by investigating the factor structure of trustworthiness. Taking items from two scales commonly employed to assess trustworthiness, we leveraged structural equation modeling to explore which theoretical model is supported by the data in an organizational trust context. We considered an array of first-order, second-order, and bifactor models. The best-fitting model was a bifactor model comprising one general trustworthiness factor and ability, benevolence, and integrity grouping factors. This model was determined to be essentially unidimensional, though this is qualified by the finding that the grouping variables accounted for significant variance with for several organizational outcome criteria. These results suggest that respondents typically employ a general factor when responding to items assessing trustworthiness, and researchers may be better served treating the construct as unidimensional or engaging in scale parceling of their models to reflect this response tendency more accurately. However, the substantial variance accounted by the grouping variables in hierarchical regression suggest there may be contexts in which it would be acceptable to consider the theoretical factors of ability, benevolence, and integrity independent of general trustworthiness.",4/1/22,9/29/22 21:05,9/29/22 21:05,9/29/22 21:05,797443,,,13,,Front Psychol,"“I Think You Are Trustworthy, Need I Say More?",,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 35432086 PMCID: PMC9012151,,"/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/H53ZGWWE/Lee et al_2022_“I Think You Are Trustworthy, Need I Say More.pdf; ",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9012151/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The term digital divide, on the other hand, represents the gap between those who use the Internet and those who cannot. It is a multidimensional concept consisting of three stages: access, use, and outcomes. The first stage refers to the physical infrastructure, the second to the intensity of use of this technology, while the third refers to the benefits associated with the use of this technology. The third stage is important because benefits could embrace economic growth and social inclusion, for example. However, prior research has focused mainly on the two first stages. Our research aims to propose a framework to analyze the three digital divide stages through the task-technology fit lens, which is a model that includes user perception of the fit between task requirements and the Internet. We have also included an additional variable to account for the level of match between user skills and the Internet (user-technology fit). At the theoretical level, our results may provide a conceptual framework to assess the digital divide dimensions and their associated outcomes.

Additionally, an observer’s BJW would exacerbate the positive relationship between observed negative workplace gossip and deservingness judgment, that is, third-party observers with high BJW are more susceptible to victim derogation bias and consider that the target of gossip deserved the victimization experience to maintain their worldview.

Yet little is known about what determines whether a specific idea for constructive change brought up by an employee will be approved or rejected by a supervisor. Drawing on interactionist theories of motivation and personality, we propose that a supervisor will be least likely to support an idea when it threatens the supervisor’s power motive, and when it is perceived to serve the employee’s own striving for power. The prosocial versus egoistic intentions attributed to the idea presenter are proposed to mediate the latter effect. We conducted three scenario-based studies in which supervisors evaluated fictitious ideas voiced by employees that – if implemented – would have power-related consequences for them as a supervisor. Results show that the higher a supervisors’ explicit power motive was, the less likely they were to support a power-threatening idea (Study 1, N = 60). Moreover, idea support was less likely when this idea was proposed by an employee that was described as high (rather than low) on power motivation (Study 2, N = 79); attributed prosocial intentions mediated this effect.

Applying SD scales to measure dishonesty or faking, however, remains a point of contention among the scientific community. This two-part study investigated if SD scales, with a True/False response format, are valid for these purposes. Initially, 46 participants completed an SD scale and 12 personality items while under instruction to “think aloud”, that is, to verbalize all the thoughts they had. These spoken thoughts were recorded and transcribed. Next, 175 judges rated the participants’ honesty in relation to each SD item, based on the participants’ transcribed spoken thoughts and their selected response to the item. The results showed that responses keyed as “socially desirable responding” were judged as significantly less honest than those not keyed as such. However, the effect size was very small, and the socially desirable responses were still being judged as somewhat honest overall. Further, participants’ SD scale sum scores were not related to the judges’ ratings of participant honesty on the personality items. Thus, overall, SD scales appear to be a poor measure of dishonesty.

7A5UNB53,journalArticle,2021,"Bazaa, Uyanga",Value congruence as an antecedent in the organization-public relationships model,Dissertations,,,,https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/handle/2346/87899,"Although a handful of scholars have tested the link between value congruence and organization-public relationships (Seltzer & Lee, 2018), ways to measure value congruence reliably in the public relations context have been underdeveloped. Hence, in Study 1, the first of the two studies comprising this dissertation project, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to develop a valid measurement scale for the value perspective construct. The EFA results imply that value perspective is a 10-item and two-factor construct.  The two dimensions of value perspective were labeled as Awareness and Congruity. There are three items that measure awareness, and seven items that measure congruity. Both dimensions showed high measurement reliability; Cronbach alphas were .95 for awareness and .97 for congruity. These estimates enabled the researcher to posit value perspective as an independent variable in the organization-public relationships (OPR) model explicating the quality of relationships between organizations and the public.   In Study 2, confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling were carried out. The specified model involving four latent variables, namely value perspective, communication outcomes, involvement, and relational states, showed good, RMSEA = .060, and acceptable model fits, CFI = .911, TLI = .908.  The structural equation modeling presents empirical results of direct, mediated, and moderated mediation effects of involvement and relational states on the association between value perspective and communication outcomes. For instance, individuals are likely to trust (Trust, OPR dimension) and accept the level of shared power (i.e., Control Mutuality, OPR dimension) with the organization if these individuals perceive their values, beliefs, and principles are the same as the organization’s values (i.e., value perspective). Similarly, the public is more satisfied with (Satisfaction, OPR dimension) and committed to (Commitment, OPR dimension) the organization when they think that their personal and organizational values are similar.  Furthermore, the link between value perspective and communication outcomes was mediated by OPR perceptions. Findings suggested that the higher the value congruence (also known as value perspective, VP) was between the public and organizations, the better the quality of relationships, which in turn led to positive outcomes, namely reputation, loyalty, and organizational effectiveness. Results also indicated that high personal involvement weakens the value perspective-communication outcomes link. The latent moderated structural equation modeling showed good RMSEA = .04, and acceptable, CFI = 0.85, TLI =0.84, model fits.    This expanded model that was built on the OPR model replicated the findings of previous research involving OPR (Seltzer & Lee, 2018), loyalty (Ledingham & Bruning, 1998) and reputation (Yang & Grunig, 2005). In addition, the current dissertation project extends the OPR model by positing value perspective as an antecedent variable predicting good quality relationships that in turn led to positive reputation, loyalty, and organizational effectiveness.    Public relations specialists are advised to be transparent and share information about the organization they represent with the public. Public relations practitioners are also encouraged to listen to their key publics’ complaints and concerns and change the organization’s behaviors accordingly so that their organizations can enjoy a good reputation and operate successfully. These teachings are based on the OPR literature that tests the link between relational antecedents, cultivation strategy, and communication outcomes. Now, based on the findings of this empirical research, public relations scholars can train future public relations practitioners to be cognizant of organizational values, particularly whether these values resonate with or are shared by the broader public. Fundamental principles and values on which organizations operate are important factors in public relations practices because these, when coupled with effective communication campaigns, are likely to decide whether organizations will fail or succeed.",2021-08,9/29/22 21:19,10/22/22 20:31,9/29/22 21:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eng,Access is not restricted.,,,,ttu-ir.tdl.org,,Accepted: 2021-09-14T19:27:20Z,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/W5LNNRS9/Bazaa_2021_Value congruence as an antecedent in the organization-public relationships model.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/UCK63QN3/87899.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At a proximate level, approach and avoidance represent core fundamental motivational systems which have been proposed to be involved in two independent moral systems: a prescriptive system responsive to obligations (“shoulds”) and a proscriptive system concerned with prohibitions (“should nots”). It is unclear whether these motivational systems or personal involvement better explain the influence of justice dispositions on moral judgments. To clarify this theoretical argument, two experiments examined how dispositional self-oriented and other-oriented justice sensitivity influence condemnation of prescriptive and proscriptive violations while manipulating perspective between-subject or within-subject. Participants rated the permissibility of everyday moral transgressions, from the perspective of the victim or a neutral observer. In Study 1 (n = 235), self-oriented dispositions increased and other-oriented dispositions decreased the probability of rating prescriptive violations as permissible. Study 2 (n = 468) replicated the effect of other-oriented justice sensitivity. Overall, these results bridge the gap between motivational systems and self-other processing. They suggest that justice sensitivity is better conceptualised as distinct motivations which can exert opposing influences on moral decision-making. Moreover, personal involvement may not be as important as individual justice motivations for explaining everyday moral decision-making.",5/18/20,9/29/22 21:19,9/29/22 21:19,9/29/22 21:19,670-683,,4,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/02699931.2019.1669536 PMID: 31556353,,,,,Empathic concern; justice motivation; prescriptive morality; proscriptive morality; social decision-making,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a sample of 228 Asian American emerging adults (70% female, Mage = 20.23), we examined profiles of parental racial-ethnic socialization messages and their relationships with racial-ethnic identity and social connectedness outcomes. Results suggested 3 profiles. The guarded separation socialization group reported receiving the most frequent messages about maintaining their heritage culture and avoiding outgroups. The passive and active integration socialization groups also received frequent messages about maintaining heritage culture, but very few messages about avoiding outgroups or minimizing the significance of race. The active integration socialization group received the most messages about becoming American, treating everyone equally, and respecting diverse cultures, compared to the passive integration socialization group, which reported receiving few of these messages. Participants in the active integration profile reported significantly higher levels of cognitive clarity and affective pride regarding their racial-ethnic identity compared to the other two profiles, while individuals in the passive and active integration profiles reported significantly higher levels of social connectedness than those in guarded separation profile.

The four types of information were given as the treatments: statistical significance with a p-value of 2%, statistical insignificance with a p-value of 25%, a 95% probability that the estimate is correct, and a 68% probability that the estimate is correct. The effect size and cost of the policy were fixed across all treatment groups. In the case of lower uncertainty, both significance and Bayesian frameworks resulted in a large proportion of participants adopting the policy (.82 and .91 respectively), while in the case of higher uncertainty, the significance framework led a much smaller proportion of participants to adopt the policy than the Bayesian framework (.39 against .83).

Specifically, we found that the more that Americans’ perceptions of inequality in their country shifted toward extreme levels—toward the view that a small minority of the population holds a much greater proportion of the state’s wealth than all other groups combined—the more likely they were to believe that both upward and downward mobility were unlikely.

Constructive leadership positively impacts employees, while destructive leadership causes counterproductive work behaviours (CWB). This study aims to investigate the effect of toxic leadership on employees' CWB via the role of turnover intention by employing the psychological contract theory. Design/methodology/approach The participants were recruited using various recruitment methods such as online recruitment and alumni networks. After dropping some participants who failed to complete the three-wave data collection procedure, 457 responses were used for the final data analysis. The participants came from various public organisations in Indonesia (e.g. hospitals). Findings The results found that the effect of toxic leadership on employees' CWB was mediated by the role of turnover intention. Under a toxic leader, employees might intend to leave the organisations and commit CWB as the employees perceived the psychological contract breach. Practical implications Firstly, public organisations should implement some strategies to reduce the emergence of toxic behaviours. Secondly, public organisations should evaluate and examine how leadership is exercised within public organisations.

However, we contend that, in addition to poorly activating ideal leader traits, Asian Americans may strongly activate ideal follower traits (e.g., industrious and reliable), and being seen as a good follower may pigeonhole Asian Americans in non-managerial roles. Across 4 studies, our findings generally supported our arguments regarding the activation of ideal follower traits and lack of activation of ideal leader traits for Asian American workers. However, compared to their majority group counterparts, we found some unexpected evidence for a more favorable view of Asian Americans as leaders, which was primarily driven by the greater activation of ideal follower traits (i.e., industry and good citizen) among Asian American workers.

Background Pandemic-related stress (e.g., financial stress) experienced by parents may indirectly affect adolescents’ well-being, although the pathways involved are currently unknown. Method Families currently living in the United States and having adolescents between 12 and 18 years old participated in this investigation (N = 272). Parents responded to questionnaires online about their financial situation, personal well-being, relationship with their oldest typically developing adolescent (12–18 years old; Mage = 14.74; SDage = 1.80; 46.4% young women), and their adolescents’ well-being. Results Higher levels of financial stress were related to higher levels of parental psychological distress, higher levels of parenting stress, and higher levels of adolescent loneliness. Higher stay-at-home intensity was related to higher levels of parenting stress, higher levels of parent–adolescent conflict, and poorer adolescent adjustment. Several significant indirect paths were identified between financial stress and adolescents’ adjustment. The relationship between financial stress and adolescents’ well-being (i.e., internalizing behaviors and loneliness) was mediated by parental psychological distress and parenting stress. When parenting stress was a mediator, the effect was more pronounced the more time families spent at home. Conclusion Parents who were worried about their financial situation had greater difficulty with psychological distress and parenting stress, especially when parents were spending more time at home.

We also lack insight into the factors that can affect such luxury consumption decisions. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether consumers prefer to buy luxury goods online at a discounted price or would rather buy luxury goods in store with additional luxury services at a cover price. This study also examines the extent to which such decisions can be driven by their situation-specific thinking styles as well as other socio-demographic variables. The results show that participants adopted a rational thinking style when deciding to buy luxury goods online with price discounts. On the other hand, an experiential thinking style was evoked when participants chose to visit a store offering luxury brands and luxury services. In addition to momentary thinking orientations, gender as well as income were found to be relevant to a consumer's choice in a shopping platform when seeking luxury brands.

However, the validity of data obtained from newer panels such as Qualtrics has not been extensively evaluated. Furthermore, few addiction researchers appear to employ previously recommended guidelines for maximizing the quality of data obtained from panel samples. The goals of the present study were as follows: (a) to evaluate the quality of survey data obtained from Qualtrics including an evaluation of the company’s internal data screening process and (b) to provide a practical implementation guide for data screening practices that maximize the quality of data obtained via panel and crowd-sourced samples. To address the goals, two panel samples evaluating vaping and video gaming behaviors were recruited in Canada via Qualtrics and underwent Qualtrics’s internal data screening process before being rigorously rescreened by the authors. The results demonstrate that while Qualtrics’s paid internal data quality process flags and removes many low-quality participants, there is still a large portion of participants presented by Qualtrics as high-quality that are likely low-quality responses that need to be screened out. The presented methodology provides a rigorous data screening protocol, including step-by-step application, for crowd-sourced samples in addictive behavior research for maximizing data quality. Researchers should be cautious in the use of Qualtrics data for administration of addiction survey research and are encouraged to use additional data screening procedures to maximize data quality.

However, existing measures tend to capture the construct with unidimensional scales, use single-item operationalizations, or focus on specific domains. Thus, the Later Life Workplace Index (LLWI) was developed to serve as a multidimensional framework for measuring organizational practices for the aging workforce. The LLWI covers 9 domains, namely organizational climate, leadership, work design, health management, individual development , knowledge management, transition to retirement, continued employment after retirement, and health and retirement coverage. The index has recently been operationalized and validated in Germany. Given that the quantitative evidence for the framework is limited to Germany so far, we aimed to translate and validate an English version of the LLWI using a sample of older U.S. employees (N = 279). Findings regarding the psychometric properties of the measure are presented, supporting the domain level factor structure through confirmatory factor analyses, but revealing some redundancy among the items for the overall 9 domain factor structure. Multigroup factor analyses comparing the U.S. sample to a German sample (N = 349) further confirmed configural and (partial) metric measurement invariance of the English version of the LLWI. Results also supported convergent and discriminant validity as well as criterion and incremental validity regarding individual level attitudinal, health-related, intention, and be-havioral outcomes.

Despite numerous benefits of non-synchronous online methods of qualitative data collection, such methods also pose unique challenges concerning participant eligibility and data quality in the qualitative domain. Due to a longer tradition of conducting non-synchronous quantitative online data collection, researchers have discussed issues related to data quality for use within quantitative research, and developed techniques to address such issues. However, such discussions have not taken place within qualitative research and due to the differences in types of data and theoretical underpinnings, only some of the techniques developed in quantitative research can be appropriately applied in qualitative research. In this paper, we address this knowledge gap by providing an important ‘how to guide’, presenting techniques to help address threats to data quality and integrity in non-synchronous online qualitative research. We start by outlining techniques developed for use in quantitative research that can be appropriately transferred to qualitative paradigms, before proposing techniques to manage challenges faced specifically by non-synchronous online qualitative research.

Participants completed an initial web survey assessing depression, anxiety and FOMO. Over the week, participants responded to daily text messages, assessing negative affect from earlier in the day. Results On a bivariate basis, FOMO, depression and anxiety severity were related to daily negative affect assessments. Using multivariate growth modeling, higher initial negative affect was related to decreasing negative affect over the week. Female sex and higher anxiety related to higher initial negative affect ratings. Higher FOMO levels related to increasing negative affect over the week. Limitations Findings were based on self-report methodology, using university students and only one week of measurement.

Meanwhile, research in this area has lagged and provided inconsistent results about the outcomes (i.e., well-being and job performance) of the use of time management behaviors. A potential reason for the inconsistent results is the lack of a universal conceptualization of time management making it difficult to compare results. Further, it may be that certain groups use and/or interpret time management behaviors in different ways. This study investigated three of the most popular measures of time management concurrently. First, the measures were examined for statistical artifacts, specifically violations of measurement equivalence, using a combination of confirmatory factor analysis and item response theory data analysis approaches. Specific hypotheses concerning groups of interest for this study (gender, age, temporal awareness) were tested with measures that included equivalent items only. Finally, based on evidence that time management may be dispositional in nature (Shahani et al., 1993; Claessens et al., 2007), the time management measures were analyzed using an ideal point response model based on increasing evidence that personality measures are better served by this model (Stark, Chernyshenko, Drasgow, and Williams, 2006; Carter et al., 2014).

People who say they don?t know (DK) their disease risk are less likely to engage in protective behavior. Purpose. This study examined possible mechanisms underlying not knowing one?s risk for common diseases. Methods. Participants were a nationally representative sample of 1005 members of a standing probability-based survey panel who answered questions about their comparative and absolute perceived risk for diabetes and colon cancer, health literacy, risk factor knowledge and health information avoidance, and beliefs about illness unpredictability. Survey satisficing was a composite assessment of not following survey instructions, nondifferentiation of responses, haphazard responding, and speeding. The primary outcomes were whether a person selected DK when asked absolute and comparative risk perception questions about diabetes or colon cancer. Base structural equation modeling path models with pathways from information avoidance and health literacy/knowledge to DK responding for each DK outcome were compared to models that also included pathways from satisficing or unpredictability beliefs. Results. Base models contained significant indirect effects of health literacy (odds ratios [ORs] = 0.94 to 0.97, all P < 0.02) and avoidance (ORs = 1.05 to 1.15, all P < 0.01) on DK responding through risk factor knowledge and a direct effect of avoidance (ORs = 1.21 to 1.28, all P < 0.02). Adding the direct effect for satisficing to models resulted in poor fit (for all outcomes, residual mean square error estimates >0.17, all weighted root mean square residuals >3.2, all Comparative Fit Index <0.47, all Tucker-Lewis Index <0.49), indicating that satisficing was not associated with DK responding. Unpredictability was associated with not knowing one?s diabetes risk (OR = 1.01, P < 0.01). Limitations. The data were cross-sectional; therefore, directionality of the pathways cannot be assumed. Conclusions. DK responders may need more health information, but it needs to be delivered differently.

Specifically, Blacks, Whites, and Asians (n = 301, 300, 269, respectively) were asked to report perceptions of their future life satisfaction during retirement using a scale developed by Gutierrez and Hershey (2014). Mean score comparisons revealed that Blacks and Asians had significantly larger mean perceived future satisfaction levels than Whites. To explore the psychological mechanisms that underlie respondents’ perceptions, 3 separate race-based path analysis models were calculated using anticipated satisfaction scores as the criterion. Predictors in the models included: engagement in financial planning activities, retirement-related financial knowledge, retirement goal clarity, future time perspective, and a set of sociodemographic indicators. Substantial differences were observed in the amount of variance captured in the criterion, with the most variability accounted for among Asians, and the least variability accounted for among Whites.

The proposed model contains 93 key factors and 11 project management process groups related to contract administration performance. An online questionnaire was used to rate the importance of each factor and group, and 223 responses were collected. The collected data were analyzed for normality, reliability, and intergroup differences. A two-part weighted fuzzy logic model was then developed to measure the CCA performance. The first part represented the group assessment, while the second part assessed the overall performance. The model, which was then implemented in two construction projects in Qatar, illustrated that the proposed model reasonably captured the CCA performance; and thereby a low level of implementing contractual risk management was concluded. The questionnaire results indicated that change control, financial, and claims and disputes resolution management were the top three groups affecting the CCA performance.

U56UQPPF,journalArticle,2022,"Niss, Laura",Topics in Sequential Decision Making and Algorithmic Fairness,Dissertations,,,,http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/174300,"The ability to collect and process data has greatly expanded the areas of application for data driven inference, predictions, and decisions. How to collect and modify data is dependent upon the ultimate goal. Two areas of research with focus on these questions are sequential decision making and algorithmic fairness. Sequential decision making is the process of a learner choosing an action, observing the outcome, and using this and previous information to determine the next action to take. Algorithmic fairness is the overarching term used to describe concern over algorithmic decisions being seen as unfair to certain groups or individuals. Biases present in training data may rise from historical inequities or improper representation. This dissertation addresses four problems in these two areas: policies for contaminated stochastic multi-armed bandits, fair representation through convex hull feasibility sampling, data debiasing, and implications of a sequential pipeline of fair/biased decisions. We start in Chapter 2 by considering the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem, with the added assumption that rewards can be contaminated some fixed proportion of the time. This reflects the scenario of when the reward is from a human response. Here there is no guarantee the observed reward is from the true reward distribution of the action. To account for the contamination, we propose an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) policy that relies on robust mean estimators. We derive inequality bounds on these estimators in the contaminated setting and give upper bounds on the regret, showing they are comparable to UCB policies in the standard stochastic setting. Through simulations, we show the effectiveness or our policies under different types of contamination.  Bias in training data is often split into two categories, representation bias and historical bias. Representation bias refers to data with no or limited samples from groups within the target population. Representation bias can result in unfair outcomes for the underrepresented groups. Historical bias refers to unwanted correlations between protected attributes and other features caused by societal inequities. It is an inherent property of the data and cannot be attenuated by more data. Addressing representational bias, Chapter 3 introduces the convex hull feasibility sampling problem. Here we develop a framework for sequentially testing whether a known point lies within the convex hull of a set of points with unknown distributions. This represents the problem of whether or not it is possible to sample an equally representative data set among labeled groups when the distribution of the sampling sources is unknown. We provide theoretical results in the 2D setting and simulations of our policy in 2 and 3 dimensions. In contrast, Chapter 4 addresses historical bias by proposing a data debiasing method based on a factor model. The goal is to remove variation caused by protected attributes that are undesirable during training. We compute the correlation between the debiased data and the original protected attributes and show that in ideal cases there is no correlation. We show empirical results with a case study. Chapter 5 explores how bias across multiple decisions—what we call a pipeline—impacts the final outcome. We show how fair decisions at each decision point can perpetuate a fair outcome, and also how a biased decision can prevent fair outcomes further down the pipeline. This highlights the importance of representative data at each training and decision period.",2022,9/29/22 21:20,10/22/22 17:11,9/29/22 21:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en_US,,,,,deepblue.lib.umich.edu,,Accepted: 2022-09-06T16:04:15Z DOI: 10.7302/6031,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/ADF69D78/Niss_2022_Topics in Sequential Decision Making and Algorithmic Fairness.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/ICR6MIG9/174300.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inspired by theoretical arguments (e.g., from socioecological psychology) and cross-cultural studies, we hypothesize and demonstrate that in addition to individual-level predictors, there are also regional differences in faking intentions (within a country) and systematic links to regional-level features. Specifically, we tested and compared individual- and region-level predictors of applicant faking intentions (N = 4860 MTurk workers) across the largest 50 Metropolitan Statistical Areas of the USA using multi-level techniques. We found individual-level effects of conscientiousness, competitive worldviews, and religiosity on individual-level faking intentions. On the regional level, macro-psychological conscientiousness was negatively associated with the average faking intentions in a region, while macro-psychological competitive worldviews (i.e., the prevailing competitive worldviews in a region) showed a positive relationship.

Small imprecisions in measurement can lead to incorrect estimation of change. Previously, expert-derived scoring inconsistency flags were developed for MADRS. Currently, we derive empirically based outlier-pattern flags, to further detect imprecisions in ratings. NEWMEDS data repository of almost 25,000 MADRS administrations from 11 registration trials of antidepressants was used to identify outlier response patterns reflecting potentially careless responses. Coverage of these flags was compared to previously published expert derived flags. Both sets of flags were also further tested in Monte Carlo simulated data as a proxy to applying flags under conditions of known inconsistency. The outlier flags derived provide cutting points to identify: (1) under and overuse of values (e.g., Scoring “1″ on 6 or more items), (2) disproportionate use of even or odd response choices (e.g., 8 or more odd values), (3) longest consecutive use of value (e.g., more than 5 items in a row scored with same value), (4) high variability within administration (standard deviation greater than 1.8), (5) outlier responses on multiple items (i.e., multivariate outliers), and (6) outlier scoring (e.g., scoring 4,5 or 6 on item 1). Outlier response flags were raised in 26% of the MADRS administration and in 97% of the Monte Carlo data. Of administrations with no expert flag, 21.7% had an outlier flag and of administrations with at least one expert flag, 27.7% also had an outlier flag. Outlier-pattern flags appear to be a useful adjunct to expert derived flags in the quest to improve measurement in clinical trials.",2/15/22,9/29/22 21:20,9/29/22 21:20,9/29/22 21:20,444-448,,,299,,Journal of Affective Disorders,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/KU5HZGG2/S0165032721013872.html,,,Consistency of measurement; MADRS; Montgomery-asberg depression rating scale; NEWMEDS; Remote monitoring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Distinct from similar constructs, such as job satisfaction and organizational commitment, job embeddedness includes community-related issues in addition to job-related issues. While existing literature has evaluated alternate ways to measure the job embeddedness construct, variable-centered approaches continue to be utilized. This approach implicitly assumes that being high or low on job embeddedness perceptions in the form of an overall composite indicates that individuals perceive each aspect and their attachment ties similarly. Thus, this study advances the job embeddedness theoretical framework by engaging in a person-centered approach. By conducting a confirmatory factor analysis, this study found that the relationship between variables and presumed underlying factors used to measure job embeddedness was best represented by a six-factor model compared to a one-, two, or three-factor model. In addition, this study conducted a latent profile analysis to examine patterns in response indicators within the sample data and found that distinct job embeddedness profiles emerged. Controlling for SDR (Socially Desirable Responding), these profiles showed unique patterns of job-based and non-job-based experiences that relate to staying on the job.

This instrument is a 15-item questionnaire, which has three factors, affective rumination, problem-solving pondering, and detachment. This measure is used in the occupational health psychology context; however, there is little evidence of its psychometric properties.Materials and Methods: A total sample of 4,100 from five different study samples was used in this cross-sectional study design in which the WRRS was used. We conducted confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) to examine the internal structure of the Work-Related Rumination Scale. Measurement invariance across sex and age was examined.Results: The three-factor model was supported; however, four items were eliminated due to their cross-loadings and factorial complexity. This 11-item Spanish version of the WRRS was invariant across sex and age. Reliability of the three-factors of WRRS were within the range of 0.74 to 0.87 using Cronbach’s alpha and McDonald’s omega. Correlations between the three factors were as expected as well as with other established measures.Conclusion: The results suggest that the WRRS-Spanish version appears to be a reliable and valid instrument to measure work-related rumination using its three factors.

Many physics departments implemented this rapid transition without the previous experience, time, and deliberation to optimize learning experiences for students. The present quasi-experimental, nonequivalent group design study examined social connections and communities of practice in both in-person and remote undergraduate physics laboratories during the Fall 2020 academic semester. A social networking and communities of practice theoretical framework guided the study design and methodology. Study participants (N=697) included in-person and remote undergraduate students in introductory physics laboratories at a research university in the Northeastern United States. A survey instrument was designed to measure students’ perspectives relating to their social connectedness with peers and instructors as well as their physics laboratory self-efficacy. Survey factor analysis identified subdimensions related to student-student social learning perspectives, student-instructor social learning perspectives, and physics laboratory self-efficacy. Analysis of variance indicated remote students experienced weaker levels of engagement with instructors and peers than in-person students, and remote students who connected with one another experienced more social engagement than remote students who did not. Remote students who connected with one another reported having a lower physics laboratory self-efficacy than their in-person counterparts. Isolated remote students did not show a statistical difference in their physics laboratory self-efficacy from their remote-connecting nor their in-person counterparts. Correlations between factors were tested, with instructor interactions most closely related to self-efficacy formation. Results suggest that remote laboratories, which have proliferated extensively during the recent pandemic, may need formalized mechanisms and incentives to promote social interactions and foster communities of practice among peers. This is also the case for student-instructor interactions, which are often diminished in the online platform and may not be socially situated within the larger class community. Sources of self-efficacy, such as creating opportunities for vicarious learning, may also inform ways these changes can be made.

This study examines the effects of local COVID-19 case rates and pandemic-related financial stress on family processes (e.g., caregiving behavior) and school-aged children’s outcomes. The project was launched shortly after stay-at-home orders began in the U.S. Data were collected online using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk), which allowed for nationwide recruitment. Using four waves of data (N = 308), with initial data collected between 4/20/20 and 5/6/20 and 2–3 weeks between each wave, this study examined the influence of local rates of COVID-19 infection on pandemic-related financial stress and the association of these constructs on maternal psychological distress and negative parenting. We also examined the potential cascade linking COVID-19 case rates and pandemic-related financial stress with child behavior problems via maternal psychological distress and negative parenting behavior, while controlling for prior child behavior problems. In line with hypotheses, higher Wave 1 (W1) pandemic-related financial stress was significantly associated with higher Wave 2 (W2) maternal psychological distress, which was significantly associated with higher Wave 3 (W3) negative parenting, which, in turn, was significantly associated with higher Wave 4 (W4) child behavior problems. In addition, the indirect effect of W1 pandemic-related financial stress on W3 negative parenting through W2 maternal psychological distress was significant. Higher W1 local COVID-19 case rates were significantly related to higher W3 negative parenting. Results suggest local COVID-19 case rates and pandemic-related financial stressors are associated with poorer child and family functioning. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.

Although the theory is generally well-supported and widely-used in industrial-organizational (I-O) and occupational health (OHP) psychology literature, more research is needed to validate its two most recent propositions; that motivation and strain can lead to increases in job resources and demands through job crafting and self-undermining behaviors, respectively. The goal of this study was to test the dynamic variable relationships in the self-undermining proposition through two research methods in an academic context. First, I developed and tested a computational model of the self-undermining proposition based in JD-R theory and other psychological theories and research. Second, I collected longitudinal data from undergraduate students at two U.S. universities and analyzed the data through cross-lagged panel analyses and repeated measures multivariate analyses of variance. The results of the two methods were contradictory. Specifically, the specifications and theoretical assumptions of the computational model resulted in simulations of a perpetual loss spiral via a positive feedback loop, whereas statistical analyses of the longitudinal data did not identify or support the self-undermining proposition. Overall, the results did not support the self-undermining proposition and were influenced by several methodological limitations of this study, but these limitations and results exemplified several broader limitations of JD-R theory and suggested that the theory is currently inviable and in need of respecification.",,9/29/22 21:21,10/22/22 19:15,9/29/22 21:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9781088334805,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/KL9I27U5/Walters_A Computational Model and Empirical Study of the Self-Undermining Proposition.pdf,,,Job demands-resources theory; Self-undermining proposition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extant research has primarily established that CAT provides utility over static personality testing when the response model is monotonic (i.e., higher standing on the trait results in participant endorsement of a higher response option). Given the recent emergence of the use of ideal point item response theory (IRT) models for personality testing—which assume that higher response probability is inversely related to an individual’s distance from the item—it is important that research examine whether these models support effective CAT, and the test characteristics that may play a role. This is because ideal point models require more response data than monotonic models to accurately estimate θ, potentially hindering the utility of CAT. The present study used real-data simulations to examine the performance of different CAT conditions using a pool of conscientiousness items calibrated under the generalized graded unfolding model (GGUM) on a sample of 1,724 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers. General measurement accuracy/precision and the accuracy of dichotomous employee selection decisions based upon theta estimates were examined while manipulating the cut-score adopted for employee selection, total test length, number of pre-adaptive items presented (i.e., an initial testlet), and the use of a sequential versus multistage testing design. Results indicate that adaptive tests outperform ideal point static tests on general measures of accuracy but not on employee selection decision accuracy. The most critical test characteristic for successful adaptive testing is the presence of an initial testlet.

We wondered instead whether the adaptiveness of these trajectories may depend on other belief systems which accompany them.  Across three studies we found that although individuals high and low in depressive symptoms both expected a better future, they differed in their beliefs about whether satisfaction comes from primarily controllable or uncontrollable sources. People lower in depressive symptoms believed that satisfaction is impacted by controllable behaviors and events which predicted motivation to engage in well-being supportive behaviors. In contrast, those higher in depressive symptoms believed satisfaction came from uncontrollable factors, accounting for less inclination to engage in well-being facilitating behaviors.

3QQ77GLN,journalArticle,2019,"Kutscher, Tanja",Measuring Job Satisfaction with Rating Scales: Problems and Remedies,Dissertations,,,10.17169/refubium-2904,https://refubium.fu-berlin.de/handle/fub188/25149,"Job satisfaction is an aspect of cognitive well-being and one of the standard indicators of quality of life. A job satisfaction measure is included in several national panel surveys. The assessment of job satisfaction with a precise and valid measure is a pre-requisite for obtaining accurate analysis results and drawing valid conclusions. However, an inadequately designed response format can impair the way respondents answer the questions, and there is reason to suspect that the 11-point rating scale standardly used in national panel surveys for assessing cognitive well-being could be a problem. Respondents may be overwhelmed by the large number of response categories and, therefore, cope with an increased response burden by using response styles (e.g., overusing particular response categories) and other types of inappropriate category use (e.g., careless responses or ignoring irrelevant or unclear categories). Consequently, data provided by panel surveys may be of reduced quality. Thus, the research in the present dissertation aimed first to investigate whether an 11-point rating scale is adequate for a valid assessment of job satisfaction, one of the relevant life domains. Due to the lack of evidence, the second aim was to examine the performance of mixed polytomous item response theory (IRT) models when applied to detect inappropriate category use under the data condition typical for panel surveys with a job satisfaction measure. The third aim was to study whether a rating scale with fewer response categories may be more optimal to measure job satisfaction. In addition, the fourth aim was to describe the personal profiles of response-style users by means of personality trait, cognitive ability, socio-demographic variables, and contextual factors. It is important to identify these profiles because a person’s use of a specific response style can occur consistently across different traits and rating scales and, therefore, is considered a type of disposition.  To examine the adequacy of an 11-point rating scale, we explored patterns of category use in the data on job satisfaction provided by the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey (first wave, n = 7,036). For this purpose, mixed polytomous IRT models were applied. The analyses showed that most respondents (60%) overused extreme response categories (e.g., adopted an extreme response style [ERS]) or the two lowest and two highest categories (e.g., adopted a so-called semi-extreme response style [semi-ERS]), whereas others demonstrated more appropriate response behavior (a so-called differential response style [DRS]). Moreover, all respondents ignored many response categories, especially those who exhibited the ERS and semi-ERS. These findings emphasize the limited adequacy of a long rating scale for assessing job satisfaction due to a large presence of inappropriate category use. Generally speaking, an 11-point rating scale does not allow one to assess fine-grained differences between respondents in their levels of job satisfaction, as intended by the developers of panel surveys. In contrast, this rating scale seems to overburden respondents with superfluous response categories and evoke response styles due to the difficulties they experience by determining the meaning of fine categories. To conclude, a rating scale with fewer response categories may be more optimal.  To address the second aim, a Monte Carlo simulation study was conducted. It included two models: the mixed partial credit model (mPCM; Rost, 1997) and the restricted mixed generalized partial credit model (rmGPCM; GPCM; Muraki, 1997; mGPCM; von Davier & Yamamoto, 2004). These models are suitable for detecting patterns of inappropriate category use. The latter model is more complex and includes freely estimated item discrimination parameters (but which are restricted to be class-invariant). In particular, the simulation study focused on identifying the required sample size for a proper application of these models. In addition, we investigated what information criteria (AIC, BIC, CAIC, AIC3, and SABIC) are effective for model selection. Analysis showed that both models performed appropriately with at least 2,500 observation. By further increasing the sample size, more accurate parameter and standard error estimates could be obtained. Generally, the simulation study revealed that the mPCM performed slightly better than the rmGPCM. Specifically, both models showed estimation problems due to low category frequencies, leading to inaccurate estimates. For the recommended sample size, both the AIC3 and the SABIC were the most suitable. For the large sample sizes (consisting of at least 4,500 cases), both the BIC and CAIC were effective. The AIC, however, was insufficiently accurate.  For the third aim, an experimental study with a between-subject design and randomization was conducted to compare the performance of two short rating scales (with 4 and 6 response categories) with that of a long rating scale (11 response categories) with regard to the presence of inappropriate category use and reliability (N = 6,999 employees from the USA). For this purpose, the multidimensional mixed polytomous IRT model was applied. Notably, the results from the simulation study were used at the preparation stage of this study (e.g., regarding the minimum sample size required within an experimental condition). Overall, when the rating scale was short, both the proportion of respondents who used a specific response style and the number of ignored response categories were reduced, indicating less bias in data collected with short rating scales. This finding confirmed the suggestion that some respondents use response styles as an adjustment strategy due to the inadequately large number of response categories offered. Interestingly, the same response styles were present regardless of rating scale length, suggesting that optimizing rating scale length can only partly prevent inappropriate category use. Apparently, a proportion of the respondents use a particular response style due to dispositions.  To attain the fourth aim, the personal profiles of respondents who used a particular response style were investigated with two datasets: (i) a small set of the potential predictors that were available in the HILDA survey (socio-demographic variables and job-related factors); and (ii) several relevant scales and variables (personality traits, cognitive ability, socio-demographic variables, and job-related factors) that were intentionally collected in the experimental study for this purpose. For both datasets, the assignment of respondents to latent classes indicating different response styles was an outcome variable. The analyses were conducted using multinomial logistic regressions. Therefore, the findings obtained on the basis of the first dataset provided the response-format-specific characteristics of response-style users (for the 11-point rating scale). By contrast, the second analysis allowed to reveal general predictors that explained the use of a particular response style, regardless of rating scale length, whereas response-format-specific predictors explained the occurrence of a response style for a certain rating scale. Specifically, some of the general predictors found for ERS use included a high level of general self-efficacy and self-perceived job autonomy; for non-ERS use, as a tendency to avoid extreme categories, a low need for cognition was the general predictor, indicating that response styles can be caused by dispositions, and therefore they can hardly be prevented by optimizing the features of a rating scale. The predictors specific to a particular response format were then socio-demographic variables, cognitive abilities, and certain job-related factors, suggesting that profiles of respondents who used a particular response style vary depending on the rating scale administrated to collect data. Presumably, these groups of predictors primarily characterize respondents who are inclined to use response styles as an adjustment strategy due to an inadequately designed rating scale.  In sum, an 11-point rating scale was shown to have serious shortcomings, including a high proportion of respondents with response styles and many ignored response categories. Therefore, this rating scale is of limited adequacy for a valid assessment of job satisfaction (and other aspects of cognitive well-being). By contrast, the 4- and 6-point rating scales showed a superior performance with regard to the presence of inappropriate category use. These short rating scales were found to have fewer respondents using response styles and to include almost no redundant response categories. Thus, these shorter rating scales are more adequate for this purpose. Generally, shorter rating scales eliminated the inappropriate category use that is primarily measure-dependent. Nevertheless, the same response styles were present in the data, regardless of rating scale length, suggesting that stable dispositions may be another major cause of response styles. Furthermore, some of these personal characteristics were identified (as general predictors). For example, ERS use could be explained by a high level of general self-efficacy and self-perceived job autonomy. Therefore, any optimizing of the rating scale may not be sufficient to eliminate effects caused by the consistent use of response styles. In this case, statistical approaches of controlling the effects of response styles should be applied. A promising approach for dealing with inappropriate category use are mixed polytomous IRT models.",2019,9/29/22 21:21,10/22/22 17:38,9/29/22 21:21,,,,,,,Measuring Job Satisfaction with Rating Scales,,,,,,,eng,http://www.fu-berlin.de/sites/refubium/rechtliches/Nutzungsbedingungen,,,,refubium.fu-berlin.de,,Accepted: 2019-07-24T08:19:56Z,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/NEQJW8VU/Kutscher_2019_Measuring Job Satisfaction with Rating Scales.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/8X3G5BVF/25149.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Sexual Experiences Survey (SES) is the most commonly used self-report measure; however, the use of multiple versions with somewhat different questions and formats may affect participants’ responses. The goal of this study was to compare the findings from three different versions of the SES in terms of prevalence, as well as convergent and discriminant validity. Method: Men ages 18–35 (N = 938) were recruited through MTurk for a study of men’s dating and sexual experiences with women. The survey included measures of demographics; convergent and discriminant validity indicators; and one randomly assigned version of the SES. Results: Participants who completed the 45-item Abbey, Parkhill, and Koss (Psychology of Women Quarterly, 29, 2005, 364–373) tactics-first version of the SES reported overall higher rates of sexual assault perpetration (43.4%) as compared to those who completed the 35-item Koss et al. (Psychology of Women Quarterly, 31, 2007, 357–370) acts-first version (27.9%) and the 16-item Abbey, Jacques-Tiura, and LeBreton (Aggressive Behavior, 37, 2011, 450–464) full sentence version (31.1%). Self-reported rates of completed rape perpetration did not significantly differ between versions (9.7%–14.1%). Correlations between the number of sexually aggressive acts which participants endorsed with common risk factors and discriminant validity indicators were similar for all three versions. Conclusions: The consistency in rates of self-reported completed rape across these disparate measures is noteworthy. Further qualitative and quantitative research is needed to evaluate how question phrasing affects reports of verbal coercion and if additional strategies should be included in future measures.

Many times these HITs serve for research purposes. In this context, a very important question is how reliable the results obtained through these platforms are, in view of the limited control a requester has on the workers’ actions. Various control techniques are currently proposed but they are not free from shortcomings, and their use must be accompanied by a deeper understanding of the workers’ behavior. In this work, we attempt to interpret the workers’ behavior and reliability level in the absence of control techniques. To do so, we perform a series of experiments with 600 distinct MTurk workers, specifically designed to elicit the worker’s level of dedication to a task, according to the task’s nature and difficulty. We show that the time required by a worker to carry out a task correlates with its difficulty, and also with the quality of the outcome. We find that there are different types of workers. While some of them are willing to invest a significant amount of time to arrive at the correct answer, at the same time we observe a significant fraction of workers that reply with a wrong answer.

Analyses of two large data sets gathered from MTurk (Sample 1: N = 2,692; Sample 2: N = 2,354) revealed two major findings: First, failing to screen for inattentive and fake respondents inflates the rates of major depression artificially and significantly (by 18.5%?27.5%). Second, after cleaning the data sets, depression in MTurk is still 1.6 to 3.6 times higher than general population estimates.

One reason lies in an inappropriate category use (e.g., in terms of response styles or ignoring superfluous categories), which occurs when respondents are faced with an overwhelmingly large number of response options. The use of response styles can also be triggered by stable respondent characteristics. The objective of the present between-subject experimental study is to explore the impact of rating scale length on the occurrence of inappropriate category use and scale reliability. In addition, this study investigates which stable respondent characteristics and job-related factors consistently predict the use of a particular response style across all experimental conditions. A sample of MTurk workers (N = 7042) filled out a 12-item online questionnaire on aspects of job satisfaction, with a 4-, 6-, or 11-point rating scale randomly assigned. Considering the three-dimensional structure of the job satisfaction measure, we applied a multidimensional extension of the restricted mixed generalized partial credit model to explore category use patterns within each condition. The results show a similar configuration of three response-style classes in all conditions. Nevertheless, the proportion of respondents who used the rating scale inappropriately was lower in the conditions with fewer response categories. An exception was the extreme response style, which showed a similar prevalence rate in all conditions. Furthermore, we found that the use of extreme response style can be explained by a high level of general self-efficacy and perceived job autonomy, regardless of rating scale length. The findings of the study demonstrate that the prevalence of inappropriate category use can be reduced by administering rating scales with six or four response categories instead of eleven. These findings may be extended to other domains of life satisfaction.",7/1/20,9/29/22 21:22,9/29/22 21:22,9/29/22 21:22,Jan-35,,1,4,,J well-being assess,The Effect of Rating Scale Length on the Occurrence of Inappropriate Category Use for the Assessment of Job Satisfaction,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/KDMP383D/Kutscher_Eid_2020_The Effect of Rating Scale Length on the Occurrence of Inappropriate Category.pdf,,,Job satisfaction; Response style; Experimental study; Mixture item response theory approach; Number of response categories; Rating scale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the empirical support for these hypotheses is limited by inconsistencies in the way socialness has been defined and measured. To further advance theory, the field must establish a clearer working definition, and research efforts could be facilitated by the availability of an extensive set of socialness ratings for individual concepts. Therefore, in the current work, we employed a novel and inclusive definition to test the extent to which socialness is reliably perceived as a broad construct, and we report socialness norms for over 8000 English words, including nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Our inclusive socialness measure shows good reliability and validity, and our analyses suggest that the socialness ratings capture aspects of word meaning which are distinct to those measured by other pertinent semantic constructs, including concreteness and emotional valence. Finally, in a series of regression analyses, we show for the first time that the socialness of a word's meaning explains unique variance in participant performance on lexical tasks. Our dataset of socialness norms has considerable item overlap with those used in both other lexical/semantic norms and in available behavioural mega-studies. They can help target testable predictions about brain and behaviour derived from multiple representation theories and neurobiological accounts of social semantics.",3/14/22,9/29/22 21:22,9/29/22 21:22,9/29/22 21:22,,,,,,Behav Res,Quantifying social semantics,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/CDUKJMVC/Diveica et al_2022_Quantifying social semantics.pdf,,,Grounded cognition; Lexical decisions; Semantic cognition; Social cognition; Word ratings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our goal for the present research was to examine whether ED was associated with men’s use of sexual coercion in their intimate relationships (which may include the use of physical coercion, psychological manipulation, or emotional manipulation to gain sexual access) and if perceived sperm competition risk (i.e., perceived risk of partner infidelity, which may place a man’s sperm into competition with sperm from another man) played a role in this association. These associations were examined in Study 1 using self-reports provided by men (N = 202) who had a mean age of 30.48 years (SD = 5.03) and were recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk). ED was found to have a large positive association with sexual coercion. However, men’s self-reports did not provide support for sperm competition risk moderating the association between ED and sexual coercion, but an exploratory analysis revealed that sperm competition risk mediated this association.

Exteroceptive sensory modalities, including taste and smell, are employed while eating and disturbances in exteroceptive sensitivity may influence eating behavior. Meal-related gastrointestinal disturbances, such as early satiety and postprandial fullness, are well-documented in eating disorders and may influence eating behavior. This study examined the relationships of perceived sensitivity to taste or smell and gastrointestinal symptoms with restrictive eating, and potential interactions between gastrointestinal symptoms and perceived sensitivity to taste or smell. Adults aged 18–65 were recruited via ResearchMatch.org (N = 420) and completed questionnaires assessing restrictive eating, perceived sensitivity to taste and smell, and gastrointestinal symptom severity. There was a weak relationship between restrictive eating and perceived sensitivity to taste (r = −0.115, p = .022) and smell (r = −0.101, p = .039). There was a strong relationship between gastrointestinal symptom severity and restrictive eating (r = 0.583, p < .001).

These are introduced in some questionnaires to reduce response style, which is a tendency to answer items regardless of their content. When a respondent fails to switch their response on facing a negatively worded item, the response is inconsistent. By analyzing data of 15-year-old students from 76 education systems that participated in PISA 2018, I investigate whether reading literacy or language spoken at home are associated with the probability of being an inconsistent responder. I expected to find that a respondent is more likely to respond inconsistently if they speak a different language at home rather than the language of the assessment. I also expected that students with higher reading literacy are less likely to respond inconsistently. I found that the proportion of inconsistent responders ranges from 9% to 33% across the education systems with an average of 17%. Using separate logistic regressions for each of the education systems with both the predictors in the model, I found that in 45 out of 76 education systems, as expected, reading literacy showed a negative association with inconsistent response. In 5 education systems, as expected, an inconsistent response is found to be more probable when a different language is used at home. However, contrary to expectation, in 7 education systems the opposite was found.

However, in active participatory sensing, which asks users to input text or upload photos, respondents often try to complete the request quickly and effortlessly, and consequently, not always accurately. In this study, we propose a method of expressing intention to contribute (EIC) for suppressing careless responses in participatory sensing tasks. We implemented a prototype system that requests two types of EIC method (tap the button, shake the phone), and conducted the experiment over two weeks with 20 participants. Through the statistical tests, we found that proposed EIC methods significantly suppressed the number of careless responses compared with the normal situation.",2022,9/29/22 21:34,9/29/22 21:34,,769-782,,,,,,,"Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering",,,,Springer International Publishing,Cham,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/BJND6WQU/Oyama et al_2022_A Method for Expressing Intention for Suppressing Careless Responses in.pdf,,,Answering behavior; Satisficing; Mobile sensing; Participatory sensing; Response reliability,"Hara, Takahiro; Yamaguchi, Hirozumi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adjusting for these inattentive responses has a substantive impact on policy impacts.

Research examining the impact of vicarious ostracism is still in its nascent stages and has not yet explored how observing ostracism might affect observers’ perceptions of human nature and antisocial inclinations. And only to a limited degree have the moderators of the effects of witnessing ostracism been identified. The present study sought to fill these gaps in the literature by determining whether observing ostracism might lead observers to subsequently perceive human nature in general less favorably (i.e., to see people as more immoral and less trustworthy) and heighten their antisocial inclinations. It further examined if these effects were moderated by observers’ dispositional attachment. I hypothesized that, after witnessing ostracism or inclusion relative to a neutral control condition, anxious attachment would predict reduced favorability of observers’ perceptions of human nature and increased antisocial inclinations. In contrast, avoidant attachment was expected to predict enhanced favorability of observers’ views of human nature and reduced antisocial inclinations, but only after witnessing ostracism. Six hundred and twenty-seven university students observed another individual be ostracized or included in an online game of ball-toss or anticipated an upcoming game. Subsequently, I assessed their views of human nature as well as their antisocial inclinations. Results partially supported hypotheses. After observing ostracism observers low in attachment anxiety were marginally more likely to report less favorable views of human nature (and a similar trend emerged after observing inclusion), while witnessing ostracism significantly increased the antisocial inclinations of observers high in attachment avoidance. Discussion focuses on the meaning and theoretical and practical implications of these results.",2018-10,9/29/22 21:34,10/22/22 17:50,9/29/22 21:34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eng,info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess,,,,mspace.lib.umanitoba.ca,,Accepted: 2018-08-16T22:07:52Z,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/L3J9F5TQ/Petsnik_2018_Dispositional attachment moderates the effect of observing ostracism on.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/XQ7WH2LA/33208.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we aimed to investigate the psychometric properties of two Mini-IPIP Spanish short forms, one balanced and one positively wording (PW).

The short forms were translated and adapted based on international guidelines. Reliability (internal and composite) and validity analyses (construct ESEM, concurrent, predictive and cross-cultural invariance through multi-group factorial models) were performed. Results For both the balanced scale and the PW one, modeling a method factor was not relevant. The reliability and validity indices of both forms were according to theory and prior studies’ findings: (a) personality factors were medium-high related to affective factors; (b) personality factors were less related to life satisfaction than affective factors; (c) life satisfaction was medium-high related to affective factors; (d) neuroticism appeared mainly related to all criteria variables; and (e) an acceptable level of invariance was achieved with regard to the English version.

Recent research in this tradition suggests that people find glossy, shiny objects and materials more attractive than flat, matte ones. The present experiment sought to replicate and extend research on the attractiveness of images printed on glossy and flat paper. To control for several possible confounding factors, glossiness was manipulated between-person and varied with methods that held constant factors like weight, color quality, and resolution. To extend past work, we explored art expertise and Openness to Experience as potential moderators. A sample of 100 adults viewed landscape photographs on either high-gloss photo paper or on identical paper in which a flat, matte spray finish had been applied. Ratings of attractiveness showed weak evidence for replication. People rated the glossy pictures as more attractive than the matte ones, but the effect size was small (d = −0.23 [−0.62, 0.16]) and not statistically significant. Attractiveness ratings were significantly moderated, however, by individual differences in the aesthetic appreciation facet of Openness to Experience. When aesthetic appreciation was high, people found the images attractive regardless of condition; when it was low, people strongly preferred the glossy images over the matte ones, thus showing the classic glossiness effect.

In particular, the CRT is thought to measure monitoring of System 1 intuitions such that, if cognitive reflection is high enough, intuitive errors will be detected and the problem will be solved. However, CRT items also require numeric ability to be answered correctly and it is unclear how much numeric ability vs. cognitive reflection contributes to better decision making. In two studies, CRT responses were used to calculate Cognitive Reflection and numeric ability; a numeracy scale was also administered. Numeric ability, measured on the CRT or the numeracy scale, accounted for the CRT's ability to predict more normative decisions (a subscale of decision-making competence, incentivized measures of impatient and risk-averse choice, and self-reported financial outcomes); Cognitive Reflection contributed no independent predictive power. Results were similar whether the two abilities were modeled (Study 1) or calculated using proportions (Studies 1 and 2). These findings demonstrate numeric ability as a robust predictor of superior decision making across multiple tasks and outcomes. They also indicate that correlations of decision performance with the CRT are insufficient evidence to implicate overriding intuitions in the decision-making biases and outcomes we examined.

Past research, however, has not modeled the data in ways that can separate general abilities like g from specific abilities. To examine if the associations between music training and intelligence are general, specific, or both, a bifactor modeling approach was applied to data from a sample of 237 young adults who varied substantially in musical expertise. People completed a range of tasks that measured several lower-order abilities: fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence (vocabulary knowledge), verbal fluency, and auditory discrimination ability. Simple correlations showed that music training correlated with all 4 lower-order abilities. A bifactor model, however, found that music training had both general (a strong association with g: β = .74 [.50, .98]) and specific (a moderate association with auditory ability: β = .37 [.08, .67]) relationships.

Robinson and Clore (2002) argued that when the amount of accessible detail decreases due to longer reporting periods, an episodic retrieval strategy is abandoned in favor of a semantic retrieval strategy. The current study further examines this shift between retrieval strategies by conceptually replicating the model of Robinson and Clore (2002) for both emotions and symptoms and by attempting to estimate the exact moment of the theorized shift. Method A sample of 469 adults reported the extent to which they experienced 8 states (excited, happy, calm, sad, anxious, angry, pain, stress) over 12 time frames (right now to in general). A series of curvilinear and piecewise linear multilevel growth models were used to examine the pattern of response times and response levels (i.e., rated intensity on a 1–5 scale) across the different time frames. Results Replicating previous results, both response times and response levels increased with longer time frames. In contrast to prior work, no consistent evidence was found for a change in response patterns that would suggest a shift in retrieval strategies (i.e., a flattening or decrease of the slope for longer time frames). The relationship between the time frames and response times/levels was similar for emotions and symptoms. Conclusions Although the current study showed a pronounced effect of time frame on response times and response levels, it did not replicate prior work that suggested a shift from episodic to semantic memory as time frame duration increased. This indicates that even for longer time frames individuals might attempt to retrieve episodic information to provide a response. We suggest that studies relying on self-report should use the same well-defined time frames across all self-reported measures.",8/9/18,9/29/22 21:35,9/29/22 21:35,9/29/22 21:35,e0201655,,8,13,,PLOS ONE,,,,,,,,en,,,,,PLoS Journals,,Publisher: Public Library of Science,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/QLZ93Y5A/article.html; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/PGWUYEXN/Walentynowicz et al_2018_The effects of time frames on self-report.pdf,,,Internet; Questionnaires; Attention; Emotions; Memory recall; Pain; Polynomials; Psychological stress,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary concern is that CMV can inflate substantive relationships, such that they appear statistically significant when they are not. Thus, understanding the nature of CMV is critical, especially when one considers the popularity—and sometimes necessity—of using self-report data. Research examining CMV has found conflicting evidence about the impact of CMV. Researchers who believe CMV influences findings have proposed solutions to combat any real or perceived potential bias, including changing survey instructions and using marker variables, but few studies have examined the efficacy of these approaches. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of these techniques and the nature of CMV using an experimental design. To conduct the experiment, multiple versions of a survey, which vary in their use of the remedial approaches, are utilized to collect data, which resulted in 1,069 usable responses. The experimental design was based on the faking literature and included instructions intended to induce or reduce the levels of CMV. Further, two different marker variables are used to determine the degree to which they create a psychological separation in substantive variables. Correlation analysis and measurement invariance are used to analyze the data. This study posits that, if CMV is a substantial concern for self-report data and these approaches are effective, then findings will differ in surveys that incorporate such approaches from surveys that do not. Results indicate few differences in experimental conditions, meaning that regardless of instructions or marker variable, substantive item correlations remained statistically similar. The results indicate this is likely due to the minimal impact of CMV, given that the proposed methods of correction did not significantly influence research findings. These findings have implications for researchers in that they do not support that CMV, or at least its proposed remedies, significantly alter findings. However, support for the null conclusions, in spite of appropriate statistical power, warrant future research examining the nature and impact of CMV.",2/24/22,9/29/22 21:35,9/29/22 21:35,9/29/22 21:35,pp49-61,,1,20,,,,,,,,,,en,"Copyright (c) 2022 Alison Wall, Marcia Simmering, Christie Fuller, Brian Waterwall",,,,www.academic-publishing.org,,Number: 1,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/N7AF5WWY/Wall et al_2022_Manipulating Common Method Variance via Experimental Conditions.pdf,,,psychological separation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dating app use and sexual racism are related to body-oriented concerns among SMM of color. However, no previous research has focused on experiences of sexual racism and body-oriented concerns among Asian SMM. The main purpose of the present study is to examine the relationship between two types of online sexual racism (racist rejection and racist exotification) and five types of body-oriented concerns among Asian SMM. The present study also investigated whether the associations between these variables differed by (a) racial/ethnic identity, (b) levels of racial/ethnic identity salience, and (c) levels of identity conflicts. East Asian (n =100) and South Asian (n = 100) SMM were recruited through online advertisements and completed measures for body-oriented concerns and online sexual racism. We found that, at large, both types of sexual racism were positively associated with all types of body-oriented concerns. Racist rejection more strongly predicted body concerns for South Asian SMM, whereas racist exotification more strongly predicted body concerns for East Asian SMM.

This thesis examines two ways that SM can interact with and experience LGBTQ community: LGBTQ community belonging (a subjective sense of belonging or being a part of LGBTQ community; Frost & Meyer, 2012; Puckett et al., 2015) and community involvement (engagement in LGBTQ nightlife, social clubs, politics, and community sports; Foster-Gimbel et al., 2020).Across two time points over an approximately 6.5 week period, 171 SM completed surveys assessing LGBTQ community belonging and community involvement, psychological well-being (depression, anxiety, loneliness, positive affect, and satisfaction with life), perceived social support, and internalized stigma. Analyses focused on (a) relations between community variables (belonging and involvement) and well-being over time, and (b) the potential mediating roles of social support and internalized stigma in these relations.

Even though screening for depression is recognized as essential, several barriers prevent its successful implementation. It is possible that better screening options can be developed. New possibilities have been opening up with advances in artificial intelligence and increasing knowledge on the connection of observable cues and psychological states. Objective: The aim of this scoping meta-review was to identify observable features of depression that can be intercepted using artificial intelligence in order to provide a stepping stone toward better recognition of depression among cancer survivors. Methods: We followed a methodological framework for scoping reviews. We searched SCOPUS and Web of Science for relevant papers on the topic, and data were extracted from the papers that met inclusion criteria. We used thematic analysis within 3 predefined categories of depression cues (ie, language, speech, and facial expression cues) to analyze the papers. Results: The search yielded 1023 papers, of which 9 met the inclusion criteria. Analysis of their findings resulted in several well-supported cues of depression in language, speech, and facial expression domains, which provides a comprehensive list of observable features that are potentially suited to be intercepted by artificial intelligence for early detection of depression. Conclusions: This review provides a synthesis of behavioral features of depression while translating this knowledge into the context of artificial intelligence–supported screening for depression in cancer survivors.",12/6/21,9/29/22 21:35,9/29/22 21:35,9/29/22 21:35,e30439,,12,8,,,"Language, Speech, and Facial Expression Features for Artificial Intelligence–Based Detection of Cancer Survivors’ Depression",,,,,,,EN,"Unless stated otherwise, all articles are open-access distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work (""first published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research..."") is properly cited with original URL and bibliographic citation information.

Yet, there are important limitations in the way in which this process has been examined. First, research on ER and alcohol use is limited to lab-based studies or cross-sectional retrospective self-report surveys. Second, the literature conceptualizes ER strategies as being either “adaptive” or “maladaptive” to describe whether strategies are helpful. Emerging research suggests effective ER requires that an individual be able to flexibly use a variety of ER strategies across time and situations (ER variability) and must be able to select the appropriate strategy for each situation (the strategy-situation fit hypothesis). Together, these aspects of ER make up the construct of ER flexibility, a process that has yet to be examined in relation to alcohol use. The current study has several aims: 1) to examine the correlates of ER flexibility, 2) to examine the relationship between ER flexibility and problematic alcohol use using a daily diary paradigm (14-day daily diary), and 3) to examine whether daily stress and 4) drinking motives (specifically, coping motives) moderated the relationships between ER flexibility and problematic alcohol use. Associations between ER flexibility indices and outcomes were complex and raise questions about the nature and the adaptiveness of ER flexibility. The only indicator that appeared to be adaptive was the ability to fit reappraisal appropriately to stressors. The other ER flexibility indices examined here (problem-solving fit, variability) showed either no association or associations that were counter to predictions. Further, the moderation findings for daily stress and coping motives were also mostly counter to hypotheses. Further investigation of the role of reappraisal fit in alcohol use disorder may prove promising, as it showed a protective effect on a few alcohol outcomes in this study. In light of these findings, more psychometric work clarifying the construct of ER flexibility is warranted.",2021,9/29/22 21:35,10/22/22 20:04,9/29/22 21:35,,,,,,,Adaptive Responding to Daily Stress,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798460423996,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/K7HGXVM7/Jenzer_2021_Adaptive Responding to Daily Stress.pdf,,,Coping; Stress; Alcohol use; Emotion regulation flexibility; Self-medication; Strategies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on two samples (Rwanda: n = 423; Philippines: n = 143), we evaluated the psychometric properties of the measure both before and after applying the anchoring vignette adjustment. Results show that adjusted scores had better measurement properties, including improved reliability and a more orthogonal correlational structure, relative to scores based on the original Likert scale. Correlations of the Big Five Personality Factors with life satisfaction were essentially unchanged after the vignette-adjustment while correlations with counterproductive were noticeably lower.

This dissertation uses the American beer market as a starting place to present three ways applied researchers can incorporate behavioral principles into economic theory. The first essay uses choice experiments designed to estimate the price sensitivity of alcohol consumption to explore the efficacy of prompts targeted at reducing inattention bias. Upon receiving feedback, inattentive respondents are given the opportunity to re-answer a so-called “trap question” that checks for attentiveness. We find that individuals who miss trap questions and do not correctly revise their responses have significantly different choice patterns as compared to individuals who correctly answer the trap question. The second essay proposes an instrumental variable approach to address the endogeneity issues associated with distinguishing preferences from perceptions. Even after correction, we find beliefs/perceptions substantially affect consumer choices of beer brands, and that perceived taste and brand familiarity are key determinants of choice. In the final essay, we empirically tests the effectiveness of two institutional nudges on the ECE in a field experiment at a bar. Focusing on craft beer sales, we manipulate the number of options on the menu and use institutional nudges (a control menu, a menu with a special prominently displayed, and a menu with Beer Advocate scores). In the field experiment, the ECE was alive and well using the control menu, but the effect reversed itself when the menu included Beer Advocate Scores. Our results suggest the ECE might be turned on and off by manipulating search costs. Taken together, these three essays show that that behavioral principles can enrich understanding of human action as it relates to consumer decision-making.",,9/29/22 21:36,10/22/22 20:02,9/29/22 21:36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9780355390445,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/DTDIRMHK/Malone_Incorporating Behavioral Principles in Primary Data Analysis with Application.pdf,,,Social sciences; Behavioral economics; Craft beer; Primary data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drawing on motivated information processing theory, we argue that prosocial motivation can spark employees to be proactive even when supervisors are perceived as discouraging. Specifically, prosocial motivation may weaken the negative relationship between perceived discouraging supervisor behaviors and proactivity by driving employees to bring about change to impact coworkers or the organization. Because they are less focused on self-interest and more focused on benefitting others, prosocially motivated employees are able to maintain their reason-to (felt responsibility for change) and can-do (efficacy to be proactive) motivation even when supervisors do not welcome proactivity. We test our hypotheses across three studies, using multisource data from employees and supervisors in two organizations (Studies 1a and 1b), and lagged data from employees working in a range of industries (Study 2). By identifying the mechanisms driving prosocially motivated employees to be proactive despite having supervisors who are perceived to be discouraging, we offer novel theoretical and practical insights regarding the effects of context on proactivity at work.

Nonconsenual sexual media sharing (NSMS), commonly referred to as “revenge pornography,” has become increasingly problematic for modern society, yet the empirical literature on consequences of NSMS is slim. The act of disseminating private images online without permission from the subject is defined as an interpersonal trauma by some, but there is little empirical research to date on any facet of the act and its consequences. In the present research, 165 adults were recruited through mTurk, social media, and flyers throughout the community. Participants were randomized into one of six experimental conditions, stratified to ensure equivalent numbers of male and female participants in each condition. Participants viewed a video portraying a victim and perpetrator giving their testimonies, and the content of these testimonies varied by condition. The type of concern that the victim emphasized as a consequence for victimization was either career concerns, emotional concerns, or both career and emotional concerns. Participants were asked general demographic questions, questions regarding their own intimate photo history, questions regarding their sexual modesty, and questions assessing for trauma history. Participants were also asked about predictions of victims’ emotional and career repercussions, and their views on appropriate consequences for perpetrators. In addition, the survey included questions used to check the validity of their data. Overall, 3% of this sample reported being personally victimized by NSMS. Consistent with hypotheses, female participants predicted that survivors of NSMS would experience more emotional symptoms and that these symptoms would last longer following victimization than did male participants. Further, as predicted, participants in conditions that displayed female victims (protagonists) of NSMS anticipated more severe emotional symptoms than those who saw male protagonists. This was particularly prevalent in the condition where only emotional but not career implications were discussed by the protagonist. There were no significant effects of protagonist gender on the extent to which participants anticipated career consequences. Consistent with hypotheses, participants with a history of trauma predicted more emotional symptoms, with a more severe impact, and longer symptom duration than participants without such a trauma history. The implications of these results are discussed in relation to the societal agreement that NSMS deserves legal intervention and that decision-making in these areas may rest, at least partly, on gender biases.",2022,9/29/22 21:36,10/22/22 19:13,9/29/22 21:36,,,,,,,Nonconsensual Sexual Media Sharing (NSMS),,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798496560856,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/9C5FWH68/Stal_2022_Nonconsensual Sexual Media Sharing (NSMS).pdf,,,Betrayal trauma; Cyber sexual abuse; Image-based sexual abuse; Nonconsensual sexual media sharing; NSMS; Revenge pornography,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study explored the construct validity of probed mind-wandering reports (i.e., reports of task-unrelated thought [TUT]) with a combined experimental and individual-differences approach. We examined laboratory data from over 1000 undergraduates at two U.S. institutions, who responded to one of four different thought-probe types across two cognitive tasks. We asked a fundamental measurement question: Do different probe types yield different results, either in terms of average reports (average TUT rates, TUT-report confidence ratings), or in terms of TUT-report associations, such as TUT rate or confidence stability across tasks, or between TUT reports and other consciousness-related constructs (retrospective mind-wandering ratings, executive-control performance, and broad questionnaire trait assessments of distractibility–restlessness and positive-constructive daydreaming)? Our primary analyses compared probes that asked subjects to report on different dimensions of experience: TUT-content probes asked about what they’d been mind-wandering about, TUT-intentionality probes asked about why they were mind-wandering, and TUT-depth probes asked about the extent (on a rating scale) of their mind-wandering. Our secondary analyses compared thought-content probes that did versus didn’t offer an option to report performance-evaluative thoughts. Our findings provide some “good news”—that some mind-wandering findings are robust across probing methods—and some “bad news”—that some findings are not robust across methods and that some commonly used probing methods may not tell us what we think they do.

Theoretical and empirical work suggest boredom may be an important predictor of problematic eating behaviors. Yet, little work has examined the role of boredom in emotional eating. Further, individual differences in the ability to recognize internal cues (i.e., interoception) may alter the impact of boredom on emotional eating. This study hypothesized that boredom proneness would predict unique variance in emotional eating after accounting for negative and positive affect, and that the association between boredom proneness and emotional eating would be stronger among those with poorer interoceptive ability compared to those with better interoceptive ability. Hypotheses were tested in two large samples using multiple linear regression. Participants aged 18–65 were recruited from MTurk (n = 365; 59.2% female) and an undergraduate research pool (n = 461; 52.9% female). Participants completed self-report measures: Boredom Proneness Scale; Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire- Emotional Eating; Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness-2; Intuitive Eating Scale-2- Reliance on Hunger and Satiety Cues; and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. Boredom proneness was a significant predictor of emotional eating in both samples, even accounting for the broad dimensions of negative and positive affect (ps < .001). Interoception did not moderate the association between boredom proneness and emotional eating in either sample (ps > .05), but was an independent predictor of emotional eating (ps < .001). Boredom proneness and interoceptive ability may warrant attention as targets in the prevention and treatment of emotional eating. Future work should continue exploring different emotion categories and different facets of interoception in emotional eating, as well as examine novel mechanisms that could inform intervention efforts.",11/1/22,9/29/22 21:36,9/29/22 21:36,9/29/22 21:36,106167,,,178,,Appetite,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/REQ9ZQ7M/S0195666322002586.html,,,Boredom; Affect; Emotional eating; Interoception,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore this topic, the current study conducted a meta-analysis of response rates to evaluate a conceptual model of predictors comprised of survey content, survey methodology, and recipient characteristics. This model was assessed via a regression analysis conducted on recent empirical articles published in prominent organizational journals across the span of fifteen years (2000-2014). In addition, variability in response rates was examined through relative weights analysis (Johnson, 2000), to investigate which predictors accounted for the most unique variability, as well as via hierarchical linear modeling, to explore variation in response rates over time. Results from an analysis of 238 studies from six top-tier journals in the organizational sciences literature supported hypothesized relationships between lower response rates and longer survey length, Web-based administration, and recipient samples with higher average job complexity. Job complexity accounted for the highest percentage of explained variance in response rates compared to other predictors, per the results of the relative weights analysis. In addition, hierarchical linear modeling results showed that there was a significant negative relationship between job complexity and response rates when accounting for the publication year of primary studies. Implications include an updated benchmark for response rates in organizational surveys of 51%, based on the summary findings. Future research on the implications of technology for survey delivery media and response enhancing techniques are discussed.",,10/6/22 14:25,10/22/22 19:49,10/6/22 14:25,,,,,,,Response Rates in 21st Century Organizational Survey Research,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9781339761565,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/T6MM2YDW/Whelan_Response Rates in 21st Century Organizational Survey Research.pdf,,,Surveys; Psychology; Meta analysis; Response rates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five different methods for detecting inattention were compared to determine which of these methods were the most effective.

These were classified into two types item based indices and non-item based indices. It was hypothesized and found that Fleischer items were viewed as less awed or out of place when compared to nonsensical and instructional item types. Additional hypotheses tested the effectiveness of each the indices and supported the hypothesis, in finding the Fleischer type and total time to be the best identifiers of inattentive respondents.

Always time consuming and demoralizing, the loss of employees is increasingly expensive as well. Sales employee turnover may be one of a company's most controllable expenses, and yet many business owners and managers ignore its devastating impact on their bottom line. Others treat turnover as an unavoidable cost of doing business and watch helplessly as their companies become revolving doors for today's increasingly transitory work force. Sales managers and researchers seem to agree that sales force turnover often reaches substantial rates, and that it is dysfunctional and costly to sales organizations. In spite of these high cost estimates few organizations seem to have developed systematic procedures and policies for keeping sales force turnover under control. Because of the negative impact a company must embrace with a high percentage of employee turnover, this researcher is concerned with the impact of organizational practices and processes that may preclude the tenure of successful employees. The purpose of this study was to describe the organizational factors that may contribute to a high voluntary turnover rate $(>$25%) among salespeople. This was a descriptive study utilizing a questionnaire to survey attitudes about job satisfaction among sales employees at a Fortune 500 business information services corporation. Following a review of the literature, a survey instrument was designed, validated by a panel of experts and field tested for reliability. The entire 92 member population of the sales team was surveyed. Forty-one salespeople, 21 service people, and 1 manager returned the questionnaire for a total of 67 responses. (Four surveys did not note job title). There were three general findings regarding the level of job satisfaction among the sales employees. First, it was determined that the majority of the respondents did not feel that the rewards (base pay, commissions, promotions, benefits, training, trips, contests, etc.) was equitable for the effort necessary to succeed in the job. The primary reasons were insufficient pay structure, few opportunities for advancement, and lack of training. Second, the majority of the respondents were very satisfied with the respect (degree of feeling valued) they garnered from the organization. Their field managers were held in esteem for listening, coaching, and supporting their efforts. Frustration was centered on issues that they knew to be outside of the their immediate manager's control. Thirdly, the majority felt that the requirements and demands of the job were higher than the rewards and/or respect they received in return. Based upon the findings, recommendations were made outlining specific strategies for reducing sales employee dissatisfaction in these areas in the hope that turnover would decrease.",,10/6/22 14:35,10/22/22 20:18,10/6/22 14:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9780591231908,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/2LKX6QC8/Langdon_Organizational variables that contribute to a high voluntary turnover rate.pdf,,,Social sciences; Psychology; turnover,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the widespread use of the CPT in research, there is no consensus regarding whether different versions of this task are measuring the same or distinct underlying constructs. The purpose of this study is to examine whether two variations of the CPT that differ in target-frequencies and response requirements measure a unitary construct or distinct constructs. Participants included 150 4-and 5-year-olds who were oversampled for elevated levels of inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive behaviors. Participants completed three X-CPTs, three NotX-CPTs, and three direct measures of inhibitory control. For each participant, a teacher completed a behavior ratings scale. Confirmatory Factor Analyses were conducted to examine whether the indices of performance on the CPT (i.e., omission errors, commission errors) measured unitary or distinct constructs across versions of the CPT. Findings suggested that the degree to which X-CPTs and NotX-CPTs measured the same underlying constructs depended on whether scores that include errors made due to disengagement in the task were included in analyses. When the scores of children who disengaged were excluded, omission errors were found to assess the same underlying construct across CPT paradigms whereas commission errors were found to assess distinct constructs. The factors representing CPT performance indices demonstrated poor convergent and discriminant relations to teacher-ratings of behavior and direct measures of inhibitory control.",,10/6/22 14:35,10/22/22 20:34,10/6/22 14:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9781369165128,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/HCJVXKXH/Allan_Do different versions of the Continuous Performance Test measure the same.pdf,,,Psychology; Assessment; Continous Performance Test; Hyperactivity; Inattention; Inhibitory control; Preschool,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Field Independence, a personality construct, is hypothesized to be related to the collection of more accurate information. Accuracy is operationalized through the creation of a Carelessness Index embedded in the job analysis task inventory. This index is comprised of items irrelevant to the job. Subjects who indicated that these irrelevant tasks are part of the job were viewed as providing less accurate information. Additional indices were included in the task inventory. A Carefulness Index was developed that consisted of tasks that were always part of the job. To the extent that subjects rated these tasks as not ""part of the job,"" their responses were viewed as less accurate. A third index used reliability of responses as an index of accuracy. To the extent that respondents rated the same items differently, their responses were viewed as less accurate. In addition, the relationship between Field Independence and all three indices was explored. The study was completed in the field. Job incumbents completed the task inventory (including demographic information), a subset of repeated items, and a measure of Field Independence. For the most part, obtained results did not support the hypotheses. Field Independence was not found to be related to either the Carelessness Index or the Carefulness Index. Nor were the Careless and Careful Indices significantly related to one another. One potential factor that may have impacted the results of the Carelessness Index is the ""relevance"" of the careless items. Results for the Carefulness Index may have been impacted by unequal sample size. Finally, Field independence, the Carelessness Index, and the Carefulness Index were not found to produce sizable or meaningful differences in job analysis results. The results of this study suggest that all groups reviewed can be used to gather job analysis information without producing significant job analysis differences.

Many previous measurement studies have found the inclusion of negative items to be detrimental to scale reliability and validity. However, these studies have rarely distinguished among negatively-worded items, negatively-keyed items, and items with negative wording and keying. The purpose of the current study was to make those distinctions and investigate why the psychometric properties of balanced scales tend to be worse than those of scales with uniformly positive wording/keying. A mixed-methods approach was employed. In Study 1 (quantitative), item wording and keying were systematically varied in adaptations of two published attitude measures that were administered to a large college student sample. Reliability and dimensionality of the resulting data were examined across the measures in each of four wording/keying configurations. Study 2 (qualitative) incorporated a mix of the same four wording/keying conditions in an adapted measure that was administered individually to a small sample of college students. A think-aloud design was implemented to elicit verbalizations that were subsequently analyzed using a thematic networks approach. Study 1 findings indicated that reliability estimates were generally highest for scales where all items were positively worded/keyed and lowest for scales with balanced keying (or balanced keying and wording). Regarding dimensionality, method variance was more evident when keying was balanced than when keying was consistent. This tended to be the case whether wording was balanced or consistent. Study 2 revealed a number of factors that could contribute to differences in the response patterns elicited by negative and positive items. These factors included the relative difficulty of processing negatively-worded statements, respondent characteristics such as reading skill and frustration tolerance, and idiosyncratic response styles. Among previously posited explanations for the differential functioning of negative and positive items, results from the studies supported some explanations (e.g., method variance; careless responding) more than others (e.g., the substantive explanation). Overall, it appeared that the psychometric consequences of balanced keying are no less substantial than those of balanced wording.",,10/6/22 14:35,10/22/22 20:30,10/6/22 14:35,,,,,,,Effects of Negative Keying and Wording in Attitude Measures,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9781303071102,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/TJMELVUK/Coleman_Effects of Negative Keying and Wording in Attitude Measures.pdf,,,Psychology; Negative wording; Attitude measurement; Confirmatory factor analysis; Method effects; Mixed methods; Negative keying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study sought to determine cut scores relative to performance on an external and well-validated measure of symptom validity, the Word Memory Test (WMT). The sample was comprised of 159 mixed clinical and/or medicolegal patients who were administered the VSVT and WMT during the course of a neuropsychological evaluation. Overall, several of the VSVT response latency variables demonstrated promise for the identification of poor effort as measured by the WMT. Specifically, Easy Item Standard Deviations in excess of 1.82 seconds, Difficult Item Response Latencies in excess of 5.15 seconds, and Difficult Item Standard Deviations in excess of 2.91 seconds each correctly identified at least 65% of the current sample as having passed or failed the WMT.

For any particular attitude survey, some respondents should naturally feel opinionated and involved with the topic, and therefore expend the mental energy needed to provide careful, precise responses. This results in a narrow response latitude and relatively favorable scale psychometric properties. Other respondents, however, probably lack a discernible opinion about the topic, and provide imprecise or careless responses. This results in wide response latitudes and relatively unfavorable psychometric scale properties. The present study is a Monte Carlo simulation, wherein response latitude width, the proportion of wide response latitudes in a sample, and sample size were systematically varied to understand the role each plays in terms of psychometric scale quality. Results indicate that response latitude width had a much greater impact on scale quality than did the proportion of wide response latitudes in a sample and sample size. Response latitudes equal to or greater than 1.50 resulted in poor psychometric quality across many quality indicators such as model-data fit and test information. Finally, internal consistency, internal validity, and external validity estimates were all relatively robust to wide response latitudes and suggest that latitude width may have a somewhat limited effect on the measurement of psychological constructs.",,10/6/22 14:35,10/22/22 20:34,10/6/22 14:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9781321485301,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/9LE8VCAA/Lake_Simulating response latitude effects in attitude surveys using I.pdf,,,Psychometrics; Psychology; Measurement; Attitude; Item response thoery; Latitudes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, empirical investigations of data quality in addiction-related samples are lacking. In this study of individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD), we compared poor quality delay discounting data to randomly generated data. A reanalysis of prior published delay discounting data was conducted comparing included, excluded, and randomly generated data samples. Nonsystematic criteria were implemented as a measure of data quality. The excluded data was statistically different from the included sample but did not differ from randomly generated data on multiple metrics. Moreover, a response bias was identified in the excluded data. This study provides empirical evidence that poor quality delay discounting data in an AUD sample is not statistically different from randomly generated data, suggesting data quality concerns on MTurk persist in addiction samples. These findings support the use of rigorous methods of a priori defined criteria to remove poor quality data post hoc. Additionally, it highlights that the use of nonsystematic delay discounting criteria to remove poor quality data is rigorous and not simply a way of removing data that does not conform to an expected theoretical model.

The current study examined officer-level outcomes in a non-urban geographical setting using a pre/post-CIT training design. The sample included 46 police officers from seven departments that would be considered rural and 13 that would be classified as suburban. Officers completed scales to gauge change in mental illness attitudes at the beginning and end of their one-week CIT training. CIT training resulted in reductions in stigmatic attitudes with seven large effect sizes (ranging from η2 = .24 to .59) across the two measures. The findings from this research are a direct response to the call for greater diversity in the size of police settings in the CIT literature and serve to expand the empirical base for CIT in relation to officer-level outcomes.,2019,10/6/22 14:55,10/6/22 14:55,10/6/22 14:55,342-352,,4,37,,,CIT in small municipalities,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/bsl.2395,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/HZHLJ637/bsl.html; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/IZL3VGTH/Strassle_2019_CIT in small municipalities.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the possible threats to data quality in user modeling, in particular in questionnaire studies, is providing careless responses (CR). When responding carelessly, subjects do not pay sufficient attention to the questions and therefore compromise the interpretability of the responses. The aim of the current study was to gain a better understanding of the occurrence and identification of CR in Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) studies, where several questionnaires usually are administered daily to the participants over the course of some days, weeks or even months. For this purpose, explorative post-hoc analysis was conducted using the data of an existing EMA study in audiological research. Completion time, variance, skipped items, acquiescence bias and number of textboxes were analyzed as potential indicators for CR both inter- and intraindividually. Furthermore, consistency was examined using linear mixed models and scanning individual questionnaires. Results showed minimal systematic inconsistencies, indicating the absence of large-scale CR. However, this type of analysis might not be appropriate for identifying CR when only occurring occasionally. Moreover, the reliability of indicators of CR might be limited in EMA studies, as the indicators also vary over the course of the study and between different situations.

Through two pre-registered studies (N = 193, collected on campus and N = 543, online participation), we investigate whether disclosing that anonymized data will be publicly shared vs. not shared influences a potential participants’ intention to take part in the study. Using both frequentist and Bayesian analysis, we conclude towards an absence of effect of a difference in data sharing policy on scores in the Big Five questionnaire and social desirability, careless response behavior, and results in the anchoring paradigm. In the second study, a lexicometric analysis of participants’ reactions to openly sharing data reveals a readiness to share data and support transparency under the condition of preserved anonymity.

In this paper, we use data collected from the Understanding America Study, a nationally representative internet panel, to study the validity of measures of non-cognitive traits, including novel measures based on survey effort. We propose that surveys can be viewed as performance tasks and that respondents provide meaningful information about relevant non-cognitive traits based on the effort they put forward in completing them. In particular, we examine the extent to which respondents provide careless answers or intentionally skip questions. We compare self-reported measures of grit, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and other personality traits, with survey-effort measures.

This study assesses these procedures in terms of mean error (ME), average absolute difference (AAD), and reliability using simulated data with known values. Several prior distributions for PRPs were compared across a number of conditions. Overall, our results revealed little differences between using the χ or lognormal distributions as priors for estimated PRPs. Both distributions produced estimates with reasonable levels of ME; however, the AAD of the estimates was high. AAD did improve slightly as the number of items increased, suggesting that increasing the number of items would ameliorate this problem.

Recent research suggests that CFC can be a domain-specific construct. In this study, we explored the psychometric properties of the Norwegian CFC-general and CFC-health questionnaires in terms of factor structure and discriminant and convergent validity and tested the association between the general and domain-specific CFC and exercise and eating behaviors. In a randomized survey experiment, 1,001 university students were assigned to either a CFC-general or a CFC-health questionnaire. In the tested models, two dimensions of CFC, consideration of immediate consequences (CFC-I) and consideration of future consequences (CFC-F), were independent variables. The exercise and eating behaviors, measured both as self-evaluated behaviors and self-reported frequency measures, were dependent variables. The results showed that in both CFC-general and CFC-health, CFC-I and CFC-F are distinct dimensions that differentially explain variance in health behaviors.

On the contrary, for participants at a midpoint level of a trait, it is perfectly logical to agree and disagree with seemingly equivalent statements (e.g., I?m not tall, but neither am I short). For this reason, regular and reversed items for a unidimensional construct were predicted to load on separate factors. Two types of reversed items?polar opposites and negated regular items?were also predicted to load on separate factors, as they are qualitatively different. An empirical study supported this explanation. Differential responding was found to be highest for participants at the mid-level of a trait and diminished toward the ends, revealing a quadratic relationship and a trait ? method interaction. Thus, our findings demonstrate that the logical response pattern of individuals at the mid-level of a trait is another previously unrecognized explanation for why the inclusion of regular and reverse-keyed items can contribute to the apparent bi-dimensionality of unidimensional constructs (for data analysis results, see https://osf.io/krh2w/).",6/1/21,10/6/22 15:00,10/6/22 15:00,10/6/22 15:00,1110-1124,,4,28,,Assessment,Why Do People Agree With Both Regular and Reversed Items?,,,,,,,en,,,,,SAGE Journals,,Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/SNDSN7QL/Kam et al_2021_Why Do People Agree With Both Regular and Reversed Items.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mahalanobis Distance (MD) was used to identify participants classified as outliers, based on a simple regression analysis. Analysis of variance highlighted significant differences between these three categories. The study found that underfit persons were more likely exhibited higher MD values than overfit or fit persons, meaning that they tended to perform as outliers. The correlation coefficients between two variables considerably increased after underfit persons were excluded in subsequent analyses. Another result showed that participants tended to consistently produce aberrant responses across the questionnaires, but that they did not consistently perform as outliers.",8/1/16,10/6/22 15:00,10/21/22 2:27,10/6/22 15:00,15-Nov,,,98,,Personality and Individual Differences,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/X79WPZEQ/S0191886916302525.html; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/MH22WEWC/Widhiarso_Sumintono_2016_Examining response aberrance as a cause of outliers in statistical analysis.pdf,,,Aberrant response; Outliers; Person-fit statistic; Rasch model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Selecting the item that provides the most information is optimal in a psychometric sense but leads to items with the largest a-parameters being overused across testing sessions, particularly in the early stages of exams when examinees have very similar scores. As more flexible IRT methods are developed, IRT is likely to become the methodology of choice for supporting structured assessments. With modern computer-based testing, response time has become particularly easy to track, and, in noncognitive testing, the number of items answered in less than two seconds can serve an effective flag for careless responding. In the three-parameter logistic model, each item is characterized by an item difficulty parameter, an item discrimination parameter, and a lower asymptote or ""guessing"" parameter.

However, theories suggests that empathy, empathic responding, and emotion regulation abilities, may all contribute to the presence or absence of prosocial behavior. While theoretical papers demonstrate relationships between these constructs, researchers to date have only focused on small aspects of this complex relationship (e.g., the relationship between sympathy and emotion regulation, the relationship between empathy and prosocial behavior). This study proposed a complex model whereby empathy was both directly related to prosocial behavior and indirectly related to prosocial behavior via sympathy or personal distress. Furthermore, this study proposed an emotion regulation framework for understanding the relation between empathy and prosocial behavior, suggesting that one's emotion regulation abilities would cause a differential presentation of empathic responses, leading to a potential increase or decrease in prosocial behavior. An adult sample was recruited. Analyses were completed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Results indicate that hypothesized model adequately fit the data. All hypothesized associations between variables were significant. However, contrary to the hypothesis, emotion regulation ability did not alter the associations between study constructs.

Furthermore, the secondary aim is to observe the relationship between perceived stress, psychological health, physical activity, and nature exposure in Germany and France during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related lockdown of April/May 2020.Methods: The study includes 419 participants who have completed the Perceived Stress Scale 10, the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF, the Godin-Shephard Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire, the modified Nature Exposure Scale, and complementary questions related to the lockdown period from April 19 to May 11, 2020. Multiple regression models were constructed to evaluate the relationship of nature exposure and physical exercise with overall stress perception and psychological health in France and Germany when considering a broad range of covariates.Results: Exposure to nature during the lockdown (ηp2 = 0.034, p < 0.001), amount of physical activity ηp2 = 0.014, p < 0.001), and psychological health (ηp2 = 0.041, p < 0.001) were greater in German compared with French participants.

The stress and psychological health regression models explained 10% of the results' variance. Physical activity (Godin Index) was a significant for both models. Nature Exposure Scale total score was a significant predictor only for psychological health. When including all significant covariates, the regression models explained 30.7% for the perceived stress and 42.1% for the psychological health total overall variance.Conclusion: Physical activity and nature exposure are significant predictors of psychological health.

WE38CDFD,journalArticle,2017,"Devlin, Elise Jae",The role of response expectancies in cancer treatment,Dissertations,,,,https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/113430,"Cancer incidence continues to grow gradually yet mortality rates have decreased, warranting research on methods of predicting and reducing treatment-related toxicities. This research project explored the influence of response expectancies, individuals’ expectations of their automatic reactions to stimuli (i.e., cancer treatment), on side effect experiences.  Although research has supported associations between response expectancies of cancer treatment-related toxicities and subsequent experience, outcomes have not been consistent. Furthermore, whether response expectancies are equally influential in under-investigated patient groups is unknown, and exploration into patients’ side effect reduction through response expectancy-based interventions is still in its infancy. The current project addressed these gaps through a meta-analysis and three empirical studies.  Meta-analysis aims (Study 1) were threefold; to replicate the relationship between expectancies of cancer toxicities and subsequent experiences, to explore if association strength differed between individual toxicity expectancies, and to investigate methodology differences on outcomes. In a pooled analysis of 27 quantitative studies, results revealed a moderate relationship between expectancies of all measured side effects and their experience. Further analyses revealed significant differences between individual toxicities, with expectancies of hair loss demonstrating the strongest relationship with subsequent experience. Measurement and sample differences were associated with varying levels of effects, explored more comprehensively using a psychometric design (Study 2).  In Study 2, the inclusion of a midpoint representing patients being ‘unsure’ whether they would experience a toxicity, and differences between the two most commonly used scales (5-point and visual analogue scales; VAS), were investigated. Forty-five men scheduled for radiotherapy for prostate cancer completed measures of side effect expectancies on both 5-point scales and VAS. Analyses revealed patients often selected ‘unsure’ on the 5-point scale, which appeared a less sensitive measure of response expectancies than VAS. For most toxicities, responses on the two scales were not highly related. Based on Study 1 and 2, careful consideration is essential when designing and pooling studies.  Study 3 collected longitudinal data from the same homogenous sample of patients with prostate cancer (N = 35, Study 2). This prospective study found that baseline response expectancies significantly and uniquely predicted 6 of the 18 radiotherapy toxicities 2-weeks into treatment (where toxicities are not yet medically expected). This signified the influence of response expectancies early in radiotherapy. Seven-weeks into treatment, response expectancies (measured at 2-weeks) predicted 7 of the 16 experienced side effects. Expectancies of sexual toxicities demonstrated moderate-to-strong associations with experience, throughout, and thus should be a clinical and research focus in the future.  Study 4 explored whether pre-treatment side effect information presented in different valence frames could influence response expectancy formation and subsequent experience. A healthy sample of 134 university students was randomised to receive information about an experimental pain induction task framed in a positive or negative format. Results revealed that although response expectancies consistently and independently predicted subsequent experience, framing had minimal impact on response expectancies and experience. Social influences through media and social media channels, were found to impact participants’ pain experiences, suggesting a clear direction for future research.",2017,10/6/22 17:25,10/22/22 17:29,10/6/22 17:25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,digital.library.adelaide.edu.au,,Accepted: 2018-07-27T00:58:28Z,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/7MJ5735E/Devlin_2017_The role of response expectancies in cancer treatment.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/6HUPFA2R/113430.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though researchers now know that non-cognitive skills and personality traits, such as conscientiousness, grit, self-control, or a growth mindset could be important for life outcomes, they struggle to find reliable measures of these skills. Self-reports are often used for analysis but these measures have been found to be affected by important biases. We study the validity of innovative more robust measures of non-cognitive skills based on performance tasks. Our first proposed measure is an adaptation, for the adult population, of the Academic Diligence Task (ADT) developed and validated among students by Galla et al. (2014). For our second type of performance task measures of non-cognitive skills, we argue that questionnaires themselves can be seen as performance tasks, such that measures of survey effort, e.g. item non-response rates and degree of carelessness in answering, could lead to meaningful measures of non-cognitive skills. New measures along with self-reports are then used to study the role of non-cognitive skills and personality traits on individual’s preparation for retirement and financial capability. In a world where individuals are increasingly asked to take responsibility of preparing for retirement and when available financial products to do so are growing in sophistication, a better understanding of how non-cognitive skills influence retirement preparation could help effective policy design.",11/10/17,10/6/22 17:25,10/22/22 19:03,10/6/22 17:25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Social Science Research Network,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/LNHLMZH8/papers.html; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/A83BX6AK/Zamarro_2017_Alternative Measures of Non-Cognitive Skills and Their Effect on Retirement.pdf,,,Financial Capability; Non-cognitive Skills; Retirement Preparation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our findings generally corroborate the response mechanism of the direction–extremity–midpoint sequence in both honest and motivated test settings. Additionally, samples in motivated test settings generally exhibit stronger directional and extreme response preferences but weaker preferences of midpoint selection than samples in unmotivated test settings. Furthermore, for actual job applicants, social desirability had a substantial effect on all directional, extreme, and midpoint response preferences.

This inconsistency highlights the importance of considering the differential impact of the pandemic on individuals. There is some evidence that mental health trajectories are heterogeneous and that both sociodemographic and personal characteristics are associated with higher risk for mental health issues. By contrast, information on the role of social factors as potential determinants of initial reactions to the pandemic and on heterogeneous trajectories over time is lacking. We analysed seven assessments of a large-scale (N = 2203) longitudinal study across 1.5 years, beginning in March 2020. Using self-report data on mental health and life satisfaction, we applied latent change models to examine initial reactions and mean changes across the pandemic. In addition, we applied latent class growth analyses to investigate whether there were distinct groups with different patterns of change. Results showed that on average, levels of life satisfaction and anxiety decreased (d = −0.31 and d = −0.11, respectively), levels of depressive symptoms increased (d = 0.13), and stress levels remained unchanged (d = −0.01) during the first year of the pandemic. For each outcome, we identified four distinct mental health trajectories. Between 5% (for anxiety) and 11% (for life satisfaction) of the sample reported consistently high—and even increasing—impairments in mental health and well-being. The trajectories of a sizeable number of people covaried with the course of the pandemic, such that people experienced better mental health when the number of COVID cases was low and when fewer restrictions were placed on public life. Low emotional support, high instrumental support, and the tendency to compare oneself with others were associated with more mental health issues. Findings show that whereas a substantial portion of people were largely unaffected by the pandemic, some individuals experienced consistently high levels of psychological distress.

Despite its relatively recent introduction to the field, the instrument is frequently and widely used. One criticism of this instrument is that it does not include validity scales to detect potentially invalidating response style, including noncredible over- and underreporting and inconsistent (random) responding. Keeley, Webb, Peterson, Roussin, and Flanagan (2016) constructed an inconsistency scale (the PID–5–INC) to assess random responding on PID–5 and proposed a number of potential cut scores that could be applied. In this study, we attempted to cross-validate the PID–5–INC, including whether the scale could detect randomly generated protocols and distinguish them from nonrandom protocols produced by two student and two clinical samples. The PID–5–INC successfully distinguished random from nonrandom protocols and the best cut scores were similar to those reported by Keeley et al. (2016). We also found that a relatively low amount of random responding compromised the psychometric validity of the PID–5 trait scales, which extended previous work on this instrument.",7/4/18,10/6/22 17:25,10/21/22 2:29,10/6/22 17:25,398-405,,4,100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/00223891.2017.1420659 PMID: 29432027,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conduct our analysis using the Measures of Effective Teaching Longitudinal Database where teachers were randomly assigned to their classrooms in the second year of the study.

However, the effects of proactive behavior on employees' well-being are relatively unknown. We theorize that when an individuals' motivation at work is characterized by pressure and coercion (high controlled motivation), with no compensatory intrinsic interest in or identification with the work (low autonomous motivation), proactive behavior is likely to deplete employees' resources, resulting in job strain. We tested this proposition in a lagged study of 127 employee-supervisor dyads across a variety of sectors. As expected, supervisor-rated proactive work behavior was positively associated with job strain when controlled motivation was high and when autonomous motivation was also low. Under all other conditions, there was no effect of proactive behavior on job strain. For example, when individuals experienced high controlled motivation yet also experienced autonomous motivation, there was no effect of proactive behavior on job strain. In sum, proactive behavior has costs in terms of job strain only when employees experience a sense of pressure and obligation in their work in the absence of any compensating autonomous motivation.",6/1/17,10/6/22 17:26,10/21/22 2:27,10/6/22 17:26,15-26,,,100,,Journal of Vocational Behavior,When does proactivity have a cost?,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/AF83KU6G/S0001879117300064.html; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/Q6W2PYDE/Strauss et al_2017_When does proactivity have a cost.pdf,,,Motivation; Self-determination theory; Job strain; Proactive behavior,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite early enthusiasm, whether these programs enhance cognitive abilities in healthy adults is a contentious area of investigation. Given the mixed findings in the literature, researchers are beginning to investigate how beliefs and attitudes toward CCT impact motivation, expectations, and gains after cognitive training.MethodWe collected survey data from 497 North American participants from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk). This survey asked novel questions regarding respondents’ beliefs about the effectiveness of CCT for improving different domains of cognition, mood, and daily life; beliefs about whether CCT programs are supported by research; and whether impressions of CCT have improved or worsened over time. Exploratory analyses are reported descriptively, while parametric tests were used to analyze a priori hypotheses.ResultsAlmost half of the surveyed participants had used CCT, and respondents with a self-reported psychological or neurological disorder were more likely to have used CCT platforms than participants without such conditions. Motivations for using CCT included curiosity; to improve or maintain cognition; to prevent cognitive decline; and/or for enjoyment or fun. Participants believed that CCT is somewhat effective for improving mood and cognition across a variety of domains. Greater age and fewer years of education predicted perceived effectiveness of CCT. Finally, participants largely reported unchanged opinions of CCT platforms over time.ConclusionOur study suggests the need for future research regarding the general population’s beliefs and attitudes toward CCT, along with knowledge translation for relevant stakeholders.",2020,10/6/22 17:32,10/6/22 17:32,10/6/22 17:32,,,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/U266MKKR/Goghari et al_2020_Attitudes and Beliefs Toward Computerized Cognitive Training in the General.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper reports on the reliability of the HAIS-Q, including test-retest reliability and internal consistency. The paper also assesses the reliability of three preliminary over-claiming items, designed specifically to complement the HAIS-Q, and identify those individuals who provide socially desirable responses. A total of 197 working Australians completed two iterations of the HAIS-Q and the over-claiming items, approximately 4 weeks apart. Results of the analysis showed that the HAIS-Q was externally reliable and internally consistent. Therefore, the HAIS-Q can be used to reliably measure information security awareness. Reliability testing on the preliminary over-claiming items was not as robust and further development is required and recommended. The implications of these findings mean that organisations can confidently use the HAIS-Q to not only measure the current state of employee information security awareness within their organisation, but they can also measure the effectiveness and impacts of training interventions, information security awareness programs and campaigns.

Understanding the retention of former entrepreneurs—those who were previously founders of business ventures—is important to firms hoping to reap the benefits of their entrepreneurial experience. We compare the duration of their retention to other employees without entrepreneurial experience and propose a theoretical model in which entrepreneurial identity and job characteristics play a central role. The time-dependent risk of voluntary turnover was estimated using survival analysis. Results from a primary survey collected from multiple firms in 2015–2018 (Study 1) reveal that former entrepreneurs quit sooner than others, and this effect was mediated by entrepreneurial identity. A second study using the NLSY79 and O*Net longitudinal dataset (Study 2) again supports this mediated relationship and further shows that the indirect effect through entrepreneurial identity was moderated such that employees with entrepreneurial identity stayed longer in jobs with favorable characteristics (i.e., high levels of work autonomy and more entrepreneurial opportunities) than other jobs. In Study 2, we were able to observe individuals’ careers over decades to capture the patterns of individual mobility—the back-and-forth exploration between businesses owned by self and others.

Although seeing your own video feedback is the predominant interface design, self-awareness research suggests that seeing oneself could induce self-consciousness and affect interaction. We created a custom video chat application and asked pairs of strangers to engage in an online personal information exchange task with or without video feedback. Feedback increased self-awareness and the use of socially-focused words, and decreased the use of words expressing certainty. In addition, mixed-gender dyads rated themselves as more socially orientated with feedback than without, which was reflected in an increased use of inclusive pronouns and affiliation words, and fewer words expressing discrepancy. However, with feedback, same-gender dyads reported greater task orientation than mixed-gender dyads reflected in increased use of task-relevant words.

In the MFC format, respondents indicate their relative preference for items measuring different attributes within blocks. Test construction for the MFC format is complex because how the items are combined affects the properties of the test. The aim of this thesis was to investigate and further develop IRT methods for the MFC format that can help to improve MFC test construction, focusing on the Thurstonian IRT model and a ranking instruction. In the first manuscript (Frick et al., 2021), we conducted an extensive simulation study on the normativity of Thurstonian IRT trait estimates. We investigated realistic test designs, removed a potential confounding with item parameter bias and compared recovery to that from classical test theory scoring and from rating scale and true-false formats. We found that with all positively keyed items, trait estimates showed ipsative properties. However, with mixed item keys, they were insensitive to otherwise suboptimal test designs. In an empirical study, we found that construct validity in the MFC format with three-item blocks was lower and criterion validity equal to the true-false format. In the second manuscript (Frick, 2021b), I developed the Faking Mixture model, a model for faking in the MFC format that allows to estimate the fakability of individual MFC blocks. A simulation study showed good parameter recovery. An empirical validation showed that the model can capture expected differences in item desirability, but also that matched blocks were not fully fake-proof. Therefore, it is worth to apply the Faking Mixture model in order to reduce fakability by removing or modifying blocks during test construction. In the third manuscript (Frick, 2021a), I proposed methods to estimate and summarize Fisher information for Thurstonian IRT models on the block level. Three simulation studies showed that the methods can accurately recover true information and are useful for test construction. It was examined how the proposed information summaries can be combined with algorithms for automated test assembly. Thus, block information can be used to assemble MFC tests that maximize reliability and have an ideal test design. In summary, this thesis provided both new methods and guidelines for MFC test construction. Modeling the block level did and will help to adequately capture the relative response process and item interactions and it can provide avenues for further psychometric developments.",2021,10/6/22 17:33,10/22/22 20:23,10/6/22 17:33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798426868526,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/9TV5AQ9F/Frick_2021_Item Response Theory for the Analysis and Construction of Multidimensional.pdf,,,Quantitative psychology; Experimental psychology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we perform the first study to investigate such vulnerabilities, and demonstrate that attackers can leverage deep learning techniques to pass attention check questions automatically. We propose AC-EasyPass, an attack framework with a concrete model, that combines convolutional neural network and weighted feature reconstruction to easily pass attention check questions. We construct the first attention check question dataset that consists of both original and augmented questions, and demonstrate the effectiveness of AC-EasyPass. We explore two simple defense methods, adding adversarial sentences and adding typos, for survey designers to mitigate the risks posed by AC-EasyPass; however, these methods are fragile due to their limitations from both technical and usability perspectives, underlining the challenging nature of defense.

The current study evaluated whether SCT predicted stress responses when controlling for ADHD and internalizing symptoms. Undergraduates (N =412) from Auburn University completed an online survey. SCT was positively related to disengagement coping (voluntary efforts to avoid stressors), involuntary disengagement (involuntary responses acting away from stressors), and involuntary engagement (involuntary responses oriented toward the stressors) and negatively related to primary control coping (responses that act upon/work toward changing the stressors or environment) and secondary control coping (effortful responses to adapt to stressors).

Some independence assumptions among latent and observable variables characterize the uncertain behavior and make the model easier to interpret. Uncertain responses are modeled by specifying probability distributions that can depict different response styles.

This approach is particularly fitting for students owing to a lack of mental health resources on campus and to high levels of Internet use among students. Because a history of interpersonal trauma (IPT) is associated with more distress and poorer academic performance, IPT history was assessed as a moderator of intervention efficacy. Students (N = 365) were randomly assigned to a mindfulness plus present control intervention, a mindfulness only intervention, or a stress management information condition that served as an active comparison. Prior research has supported the efficacy of the mindfulness plus present control intervention (Nguyen-Feng et al., 2015). Outcome measures were self-report measures of stress, anxiety, depression, and perceived stress completed online at preintervention, postintervention, and 2 follow-ups (2–3 weeks and 4–5 weeks postintervention). Linear mixed modeling was used to assess change over time. Participants in all 3 groups reported significant decreases on all primary outcomes. All time-by-intervention group interaction effects were nonsignificant, suggesting that the 3 conditions were equally effective. When examining IPT history as a moderator, the mindfulness plus present control and stress management conditions were both more effective for IPT survivors than the mindfulness only intervention. Results suggested that Internet-based interventions are effective for lowering distress among college students and that specific approaches may be differentially effective for certain subgroups of students. They also suggested that providing students with stress management information without providing training in 1 specific skill may also be helpful.

Differences in response quality are usually explained by personality, or socio-demographic or cognitive characteristics. Little, however, is known about how respondents’ political attitudes, values, and opinions impact on quality aspects. This is a striking analytical omission, as potential associations between political values and various forms of response biases and artefacts call into question surveys’ ability to represent ‘public opinion’. In this contribution, response quality is traced back to respondents’ political and ideological dispositions. For this purpose, a relational understanding of response quality is applied that takes into account different aspects of response behaviors, as well as the interrelations between these indicators. Using data from the US General Social Survey (2010–2014), an empirical typology of response quality is created via finite mixture analysis. The resulting classes are then related to positions in the US field of ideological dispositions, constructed via multiple correspondence analysis. The analyses reveal that there are (1) different combinations of response patterns and thus different empirical response types, and (2) that these types of response quality systematically vary with regard to the respondents’ political and ideological (dis)positions.

We test our model by utilizing two studies, namely one experimental vignette study among potential applicants (N = 475) and one retrospective field study among actual job applicants (N = 335). With the exception of the assessment stage in Study 1, the positive indirect effects found in both studies indicated that applicants perceive digital selection methods to be more innovative.

However, in order to separate constructs to be measured and response tendencies, specific constraints have to be imposed on varying thresholds and their interrelations. In this article, a multidimensional extension of a Partial Credit Model using a sum-to-zero constraint for varying thresholds is proposed. The new model allows us to flexibly account for response tendencies and to model covariations between varying thresholds that are commonly found in empirical data. The model's ability to estimate different types of response tendencies under various data structures is shown in a simulation study. An illustrative multicountry analysis demonstrates that differences between respondents in terms of their response tendencies exist and can be captured by the new model. Furthermore, it is well suited to account for extreme and mid response styles, but also to accommodate unknown, previously unmodeled, response tendencies. Therewith, the sum-to-zero model can be considered a suitable candidate to examine the types response tendencies in rating data and to account for biases in construct measures due to response tendencies.",2021,10/6/22 17:33,10/6/22 17:33,10/6/22 17:33,104-129,,1,58,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jedm.12268,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/IWXHKRXM/Henninger_2021_A Novel Partial Credit Extension Using Varying Thresholds to Account for.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/XAFS6JJ6/jedm.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we propose that such low-quality responding (LQR) can carry substantive meaning at older ages. Completing questionnaires is a cognitively demanding task and LQR among older adults may reflect early signals of cognitive deficits and pathological aging. We hypothesized that older people displaying greater LQR would show faster cognitive decline and greater mortality risk.We analyzed data from 9, 288 adults 65 years or older in the Health and Retirement Study. Indicators of LQR were derived from participants’ response patterns in 102 psychosocial questionnaire items administered in 2006–2008. Latent growth models examined whether LQR predicted initial status and change in cognitive functioning, assessed with the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status, over the subsequent 10 years. Discrete-time survival models examined whether LQR was associated with mortality risk over the 10 years. We also examined evidence for indirect (mediated) effects in which LQR predicts mortality via cognitive trajectories.After adjusting for age, gender, race, marital status, education, health conditions, smoking status, physical activity, and depressive symptoms, greater LQR was cross-sectionally associated with poorer cognitive functioning, and prospectively associated with faster cognitive decline over the follow-up period. Furthermore, greater LQR was associated with increased mortality risk during follow-up, and this effect was partially accounted for by the associations between LQR and cognitive functioning.Self-report questionnaires are not formally designed as cognitive tasks, but this study shows that LQR indicators derived from self-report measures provide objective, performance-based information about individuals’ cognitive functioning and survival. Self-report surveys are ubiquitous in social science, and indicators of LQR may be of broad relevance as predictors of cognitive and health trajectories in older people.",5/1/22,10/6/22 17:33,10/6/22 17:33,10/6/22 17:33,igac027,,3,6,,Innovation in Aging,,,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/QDAYAVMZ/Schneider et al_2022_Quality of Survey Responses at Older Ages Predicts Cognitive Decline and.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/QINUITPA/6571518.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that random responders produce large ISDs because they respond to items all over a measure’s response range, whereas conscientious responders produce small ISDs because they respond to items more consistently. We administered a questionnaire containing the NEO-FFI-3 and an embedded validity scale to 134 university students. Another 134 responders were created using a random number generator.

Results showed that (1) random responders produce significantly larger ISDs than conscientious responders, (2) the ISDs were strongly correlated with the embedded validity scale and with one another, and (3) the ISDs correctly identified responders with greater than 80% classification accuracy. The mean ISD yielded greater than 95% classification accuracy. This study shows that responders can be identified by quantifying inter-item response variance.",10/1/15,10/6/22 17:34,10/21/22 2:27,10/6/22 17:34,79-83,,,84,,Personality and Individual Differences,The inter-item standard deviation (ISD),Theory and Measurement in Personality and Individual Differences,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/P3UEYLW8/Marjanovic et al_2015_The inter-item standard deviation (ISD).pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/RBZ2QAH8/S0191886914004668.html,,,Personality; Random responding; Validity scale; Psychometric; Inventory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All of these aspects, which until now have mostly been investigated separately, were assessed online for 373 participants after they read a chapter of Homer’s The Odyssey. To measure flow, we administered an extended and revised reading-specific flow scale, which showed adequate factorial structure, good reliability estimates, and theoretically expected associations with flow-related constructs and criteria. Despite rather high intercorrelations, confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that flow, presence, identification, suspense, and cognitive involvement constituted distinguishable dimensions within the fiction reading experience. Structural equation modeling further provided evidence that flow can be a key component in this experience. Specifically, it revealed positive effects of flow on presence, identification, suspense, reading pleasure, and text comprehension. Model comparisons supported the role of flow as a mediator and catalyst for other positive reading dimensions. Moreover, pruned models suggested that flow together with suspense increased the model’s predictive validity by serving as a suppressor variable. Although, to date, the concept of flow has played only a minor role in research on fiction reading, our results suggest that it deserves being integrated into future theoretical frameworks and empirical investigations of positive reading experiences.

KR20 and α are common measures in classical test theory, whereas R is developed in modern test theory and, more precisely, in Rasch measurement. These three measures specify the observed variance as the sum of true variance and error variance. However, they differ for the way in which these quantities are obtained. KR20 uses the error variance of an “average” respondent from the sample, which overestimates the error variance of respondents with high or low scores. Conversely, R uses the actual average error variance of the sample. KR20 and α use respondents’ test scores in calculating the observed variance. This is potentially misleading because test scores are not linear representations of the underlying variable, whereas calculation of variance requires linearity. Contrariwise, if the data fit the Rasch model, the measures estimated for each respondent are on a linear scale, thus being numerically suitable for calculating the observed variance. Given these differences, R is expected to be a better index of internal consistency than KR20 and α. The present work compares the three measures on simulated data sets with dichotomous and polytomous items. It is shown that all the estimates of internal consistency decrease with the increasing of the skewness of the score distribution, with R decreasing to a larger extent. Thus, R is more conservative than KR20 and α, and prevents test users from believing a test has better measurement characteristics than it actually has. In addition, it is shown that Rasch-based infit and outfit person statistics can be used for handling data sets with random responses. Two options are described. The first one implies computing a more conservative estimate of internal consistency. The second one implies detecting individuals with random responses. When there are a few individuals with a consistent number of random responses, infit and outfit allow for correctly detecting almost all of them. Once these individuals are removed, a “cleaned” data set is obtained that can be used for computing a less biased estimate of internal consistency.",2019,10/6/22 17:34,10/6/22 17:34,10/6/22 17:34,,,,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/RVYAGEQ9/Anselmi et al_2019_A Comparison of Classical and Modern Measures of Internal Consistency.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While individual as well as contextual factors are considered important for gaining a better understanding of cultural influences, research on causal beliefs about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and cultural correlates in laypersons is scarce.Objective This study aimed at gaining a better understanding of the association between causal beliefs about PTSD and cultural aspects, as well as other contextual and individual correlates of causal beliefs.Method We conducted a cross-sectional, vignette-based online survey with 737 laypersons from Mexico, Ecuador, Germany, Greece, and Russia. Participants completed the revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R) and reported several cultural and sociodemographic (e.g. country of residence, gender, personal values) as well as mental health–related variables (e.g. PTSD symptoms, previous seeking of help). Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed to identify subgroups of individuals expressing similar causal beliefs for PTSD. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyse covariates of class membership.Results LCA resulted in a three-class solution of casual beliefs: a traumatic event–focused class (41.1%); an intrapersonal causes class (40.1%); and a multiple causes class (18.0%). Multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed country of residence, gender, personal value of security, PTSD symptoms, and mental health literacy as significant covariates of class membership.Conclusions Integrating a more diverse concept of culture into cultural clinical research can be a valuable addition to group comparisons based on nationality or ethnicity. Cultural clinical research needs to move towards a more integrated approach that accounts for the complexity of culture. Including additional contextual and sociodemographic factors can help to reach a more accurate understanding of the cultural influences on the development of causal beliefs and mental health.",7/29/22,10/6/22 17:34,10/6/22 17:34,10/6/22 17:34,2029333,,1,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2022.2029333,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/ZJKIB7ZQ/Meyer et al_2022_Lay causal beliefs about PTSD and cultural correlates in five countries.pdf,,,trauma; Russia; illness perceptions; Alemania; cultural clinical psychology; Ecuador; Germany; Grecia; Greece; Mexico; México; percepción de la enfermedad; Post-traumatic stress disorder; psicología clínica cultural; Rusia; Trastorno por estrés postraumático; valores; values; 价值观; 俄罗斯; 创伤; 创伤后应激障碍; 厄瓜多尔; 希腊; 德国; 文化临床心理学; 疾病认知; 墨西哥,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scholars have argued that this type of work is inherently demeaning. We seek to explore the worker’s perspective and how their long-term perspective aligns or misaligns with their actual work arrangement. We draw on career construction theory and hypothesize a job–career congruence model suggesting that when workers’ cognitive presentations of their microwork as jobs or careers are incongruent, they are less likely to experience their work as meaningful. The results from a two-stage field study of 803 workers from two microworking platforms support the negative effect of an incongruent job–career schema on workers’ experience of meaningful work. Additionally, results demonstrate that even workers who are proactive in nature, seem unable to excel in these fluid work settings when their job-career schema are not aligned. Practitioner Points Contrary to what platform organizations may expect, digital labourers view crowdworking as both a job and a career, which in turn fosters meaningfulness. Careers are important aspect in understanding digital labourers’ understanding of their jobs and careers. Keeping this in mind, we would encourage platform organizations to: provide career development opportunities, instead of focusing on short-term incentives. This would cultivate crowdworkers’ career outlook, cultivate job–career congruence, and help mediate issues related to lack of career prosperity in microwork design. recognize aspirational career elements, such as career ladders, employability, and work–life balance to reduce possible exploitation in this employment area. Focusing only on job features such as flexibility, autonomy, and rewards is insufficient to motivate and inspire meaningfulness among digital labourers. provide training focused on career adaptability.

We aimed to (a) provide missing causal evidence of this effect, (b) identify whether the expectations distort the perceived probability of a bacterial infection either in a pre- or postdecisional distortions pathway, and (c) detect possible moderators of this effect. Method: Family physicians expressed their willingness to prescribe antibiotics (Experiment 1, n₁ = 305) or their decision to prescribe (Experiment 2, n₂ = 131) and assessed the probability of a bacterial infection in hypothetical patients with infections either with low or high expectations for antibiotics. Response order of prescribing/probability was manipulated in Experiment 1. Results: Overall, the expectations for antibiotics increased intention to prescribe (Experiment 1, F(1, 301) = 25.32, pp² = .08, regardless of the response order; Experiment 2, odds ratio [OR] = 2.31, and OR = 0.75, Vignettes 1 and 2, respectively).

Physicians’ experience was positively associated with prescribing, but it did not moderate the expectations effect on prescribing. Conclusions: Patients’ and their parents’ expectations increase antibiotics prescribing, but their effect is localized—it does not leak into the perceived probability of a bacterial infection.

However, this has been largely based on female patients undergoing chemotherapy. Objectives We tested whether this association also occurred in a novel cohort, men with prostate cancer undergoing radiotherapy. We investigated these associations throughout treatment (before and after side effects were medically predicted to occur), controlling known and novel variables. Methods Homogenous male patients scheduled for radiotherapy (N = 35, mean age 71 years) completed baseline (pretreatment) measures; response expectancies of 18 treatment-related side effects; questions about baseline health and hormonal treatment, emotional state, and coping style. Response expectancies of the side effects were again measured two weeks into treatment. The severity of the same 18 toxicities was assessed two and seven weeks into treatment. Results Hierarchical multiple linear regressions revealed baseline response expectancies significantly and independently predicted six of 18 toxicities two weeks into radiotherapy, contributing 12%–30% of explained variance (β = 0.39–0.59). Response expectancies assessed two weeks into treatment significantly and uniquely predicted seven of 17 experienced toxicities at seven weeks, explaining 17%–50% of variance (β = 0.49–0.91). Sexual toxicity response expectancies revealed the strongest associations with experience throughout treatment (β = 0.46–0.91), with “inability to reach orgasm” showing the largest effect. Conclusion In this older male sample, response expectancies of side effects predicted experiences throughout treatment, including the period before toxicities were medically expected. Response expectancies of sexual side effects were robust, independent predictors of subsequent toxicities across treatment, especially issues with orgasm, warranting focus in practice and future research.",2/1/19,10/6/22 17:34,10/6/22 17:34,10/6/22 17:34,273-281.e4,,2,57,,Journal of Pain and Symptom Management,“Just As I Expected”,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/MWQWSWAI/Devlin et al_2019_“Just As I Expected”.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/CQSCZJ78/S0885392418310637.html,,,psychology; Expect; nocebo; oncology; radiotherapy; sexual dysfunction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, online data collection is often conducted without adequate attention to implementation details. One example is the frequent use of the forced answering option, which forces the respondent to answer each question in order to proceed through the questionnaire. The avoidance of missing data is often the idea behind the use of the forced answering option. However, we suggest that the costs of a reactance effect in terms of quality reduction and unit nonresponse may be high because respondents typically have plausible reasons for not answering questions. The objective of the study reported in this paper was to test the influence of forced answering on dropout rates and data quality. The results show that requiring participants answer every question increases dropout rates and decreases quality of answers.

In this study, we use specification curve analysis to examine analytical flexibility and the strength of the relationship between dysregulated gaming and well-being in the form of general mental health, depressive mood and life satisfaction. Dutch and Flemish gamers (n = 424) completed an online survey containing five unique dysregulated gaming measures (covering nine scale variants) and three well-being measures. We find a consistent negative relationship; across 972 justifiable regression models, the median standardized regression coefficient was −0.39 (min: −0.54, max: −0.19). Data show that the majority of dysregulated gaming operationalizations converge upon highly similar estimates of well-being. However, variance is introduced by the choice of well-being measure; results indicate that dysregulated gaming is more strongly associated with depressive mood than with life satisfaction. Weekly game time accounted for little to no unique variance in well-being in the sample. We argue that research on this topic should compare a broad range of psychosocial well-being outcomes and explore possible simplifications of the DSM-5 gaming disorder criteria. Given somewhat minute differences between dysregulated gaming scales when used in survey-based studies and largely equivalent relationships with mental health indicators, harmonization of measurement should be a priority.",,10/6/22 17:35,10/6/22 17:35,10/6/22 17:35,201385,,5,8,,,The relationship between mental well-being and dysregulated gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon),,Publisher: Royal Society,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/CGBMCJF6/Ballou_Van Rooij_The relationship between mental well-being and dysregulated gaming.pdf,,,well-being; dysregulated gaming; gaming disorder; specification curve analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods Using the precaution adoption process model (PAPM), parents were classified according to one of six stages of decision making: unaware, unengaged, undecided, decided not to vaccinate, decided to vaccinate, or vaccinated. Parents responded to an open-ended question: ‘What would influence your decision to have your son vaccinated or not against HPV?’ Results Three thousand one hundred and seventeen parents provided 2,874 interpretable narrative responses that were coded using thematic content analyses. The majority of parents were in the earlier precaution adoption process model stages, that is, unaware that the HPV vaccine could be given to boys (57.0%), unengaged (20.9%), or undecided (9.1%). Needing more information, vaccine cost, risks associated with vaccination, and wanting a doctor's recommendation influenced these earlier-staged parents' decisions. Parents who decided not to vaccinate their sons (6.8%) reported their decision was due to the risks, insufficient research, lack of confidence in vaccines, and/or no need for the vaccine (as their sons are not sexually active and/or too young). Parents who had decided to vaccinate their sons (5.0%) or who had vaccinated their sons (1.1%) reported that their decisions were based on protecting their sons' health and preventing disease. Conclusion There are important differences in the factors that influence parents' decision depending on where they are along the decision-making trajectory. Assuring that parents are well informed about the importance of male vaccination, reducing vaccine cost, accurately communicating vaccine safety, and improving patient–provider communication may augment vaccine coverage and prevent HPV-associated cancers in Canada.

In general, the extent to which layoff victims were treated with respect was consistently found to increase perceptions of interpersonal and procedural fairness and to mitigate negative attitudes toward the employer. Further results showed that layoff victims preferred to be given an adequate (vs. inadequate) explanation of the reasons for the layoff and to receive notice from the direct supervisor (vs. an external consultant). Relationships between the layoff agent’s actions and layoff victims’ negative attitudes toward the employer were mediated by perceptions of procedural fairness.

We further reasoned that this indirect curvilinear effect is contingent on employees’ time management skill. To test our theoretical model, we conducted two studies. In Study 1, multi-time data collected from 243 Master of Public Administration (MPA) students showed that cyberloafing had an inverted U-shaped (curvilinear) relationship with task performance, and relaxation mediated this relationship.

Particularly, if a study offers incentives, some participants may attempt to enroll multiple times. We propose a method to identify clusters of non-independent enrollments in a web-based study, motivated by an analysis of survey data which tests the effectiveness of an online skin-cancer risk reduction program. Methods To identify groups of enrollments, we used a hierarchical clustering algorithm based on the Euclidean distance matrix formed by participant responses to a series of Likert-type eligibility questions. We then systematically identified clusters that are unusual in terms of both size and similarity, by repeatedly simulating datasets from the empirical distribution of responses under the assumption of independent enrollments. By performing the clustering algorithm on the simulated datasets, we determined the distribution of cluster size and similarity under independence, which is then used to identify groups of outliers in the observed data. Next, we assessed 12 other quality indicators, including previously proposed and study-specific measures. We summarized the quality measures by cluster membership, and compared the cluster groupings to those found when using the quality indicators with latent class modeling. Results and conclusions When we excluded the clustered enrollments and/or lower-quality latent classes from the analysis of study outcomes, the estimates of the intervention effect were larger. This demonstrates how including repeat or low quality participants can introduce bias into a web-based study. As much as is possible, web-based surveys should be designed to verify participant quality. Our method can be used to verify survey quality and identify problematic groups of enrollments when necessary.",9/25/18,10/6/22 17:40,10/6/22 17:40,10/6/22 17:40,e0204394,,9,13,,PLOS ONE,,,,,,,,en,,,,,PLoS Journals,,Publisher: Public Library of Science,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/S8HUIMUY/Handorf et al_2018_A hierarchical clustering approach to identify repeated enrollments in web.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/3RIEHA5T/article.html,,,Internet; Surveys; Questionnaires; Survey research; Young adults; Cancer risk factors; Hierarchical clustering; Skin tumors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

M4WCAW86,journalArticle,2021,"Pozolotina, Tatiana",Present and future time perspectives and health behavior,Dissertations,,,,https://munin.uit.no/handle/10037/20550,"<p><i>Background and purpose: </i>Lifestyle diseases are the leading cause of life-time disability and death in modern society. Knowledge of the underlying causes and mechanisms of health behavior choices is crucially important when developing health-promoting campaigns and planning health behavior interventions. This dissertation aimed to advance our understanding of the relationship between time perspective (TP) and health behavior. The six major objectives were:  <ul>  <li>to establish the discriminant validity between the present and future dimensions of the two most frequently used operationalizations of TP: the Consideration of Future Consequences Scale (CFCS) and Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI), as well as to compare their relationships with health behavior.</li>  <li>to establish the discriminant validity between the consideration of immediate and future consequences (CFC-I and CFC-F), and to test whether they differentially predict healthy and unhealthy behaviors.</li>  <li>to explore CFCS-based, ZTPI-present/future based, and a combined CFCS and ZTPI-present/future based temporal profiles of the Norwegian population.</li>  <li>to test whether the domain-specific CFC-health would be more strongly related to health behaviors than the general CFC.</li>  <li>to study the direct effect of perceived connectedness to the future self on health behavior, as well as its moderating effect on the relationship between CFCS and health behaviors.</li>  <li>to test the moderating effect of age on the relationship between TP and smoking behavior.</li>  </ul>  <p><i>Design/methodology/approach:</i> This dissertation utilized a quantitative survey design and a survey experiment. The data are analyzed with t-tests, confirmatory factor analyses, structural equation modeling (SEM), and cluster analyses.  <p><i>Results:</i> Paper 1 established the discriminant validity of the present and future time perspective constructs of CFCS and ZTPI, as well as the discriminant validity of the present and future constructs of both scales. The present TP – but not future TP –  of both scales was related to smoking. The ZTPI model had stronger predictive power than the CFCS model.  <p>Paper 2 revealed present and future temporal profiles in the general Norwegian population. CFCS-based profiles were more predictive of health behaviors than ZTPI-based profiles. However, the profiles based on the combination of both CFCS and ZTPI variables were more predictive of smoking, exercising, and health intentions.  <p>Paper 3 established the discriminant validity between CFC-I and CFC-F that differentially predicted health behaviors. CFC-I was associated with unhealthy behaviors, whereas CFC-F was associated with healthy behaviors. PCFS had a direct negative effect on healthy behaviors, strengthened the positive effect of CFC-I and weakened the negative effect of CFC-F on unhealthy behaviors.  <p>Paper 4 established in a randomized experimental design that a domain-specific CFC–health was a better predictor of self-reported eating and exercising behaviors than a general CFC. Moreover, the discriminant validity between health-specific CFC-I and CFC-F was established. Health-specific CFC-F was a stronger predictor of exercise behavior than CFC-I.   <p><i>Conclusions and practical implications:</i>The results of the study indicate that the present and the future TPs are related but distinct constructs that differentially predict healthy and unhealthy behaviors. The relationship between CFC and health behavior is likely influenced by regulatory focus. In western societies, where the promotion regulatory orientation dominates, individuals are more likely to be motivated by approach goals rather than avoidance goals. The findings suggest that future orientation was associated with healthy behaviors, but not with unhealthy behaviors. At the same time, present-oriented people were more engaged in unhealthy behaviors, but were not less engaged in healthy behaviors. The findings suggest that emphasizing the future health benefits of healthy choices and reducing the immediate attractiveness of unhealthy choices might be more effective in the Norwegian population.   <p>Another finding was that CFCS-based population profiles were more predictive of health behaviors than ZTPI-based profiles; however, the profiles based on a combination of CFCS and ZTPI differed in their health behaviors the most. These findings could be helpful when choosing the basis on which to segment the population during health intervention programs.  <p>We demonstrated that a domain-specific CFC-health was more effective at predicting health behaviors than a general CFC.  The usage of CFC-health in future studies might increase effect sizes and the overall predictive power of the models and, thus, decrease the ambiguity of the findings.  <p>Finally, we showed that lack of connection with the future self influenced health behaviors both directly and indirectly.

Yet, as more evidence emerged pointing to the possible relation between need dissatisfaction and higher vulnerability for ill-being and psychopathology, the present study aimed to incorporate the impacts of both satisfaction and dissatisfaction for autonomy, competence, and relatedness in explaining Internet gaming disorder (IGD), a condition that may in turn impede eudaimonic well-being as indicated by flourishing.

We examine these effects across two studies using multisource data (employees and supervisors in Study 1; employees and coworkers in Study 2). Results reveal that consideration and structure have distinct effects across distributive, procedural, informational, and interpersonal dimensions of justice. Moreover, results suggest that consideration and structure have multiplicative effects on employee CWB. We find the highest levels of CWB among employees of supervisors who exhibit high structure and low consideration. Interestingly, results also suggest that the effects of structure on CWB may be curvilinear (u-shaped) such that moderate levels of structure are associated with the lowest levels of CWB. We discuss implications for future consideration and structure research as well as managerial practice.

Using longitudinal data from 899 US-based participants across 5 waves (March to June 2020), we investigated the trajectory of job insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic and how this trajectory depended on habitual coping strategies such as planning, reappraisal, and distraction. Results from latent growth curve analysis indicated that on average, job insecurity initially increased and then decreased after signing of the coronavirus stimulus bill, suggesting a pattern of shock followed by adjustment. During the shock phase, habitual use of distraction was related to less increases in job insecurity. Later during the adjustment phase, decreases in job insecurity were more pronounced for individuals with higher habitual use of planning, but were not affected by reappraisal or distraction. Hence, different coping strategies appear beneficial in different phases of adjustment, and the beneficial effect of planning may take time to manifest.

Drawing on three distinct samples from participants working in diverse occupations (81 Portugal-based team leaders working under direct supervision; 177 US-based supervised full-time workers and 242 US-based employees working full-time and under direct supervision), we found that perceived supervisor support (PSS) moderated the emotional exhaustion-planning association, whereas searching for instrumental social support moderated the planning-happiness relationship. We also found that the indirect effect of emotional exhaustion on happiness, via planning, was positive and significant only when employees perceived low supervisor support and searched highly for instrumental social support.

Although research focuses almost exclusively on either individual psychological problems or family maltreatment, there is substantial co-occurrence of these problems. Similarly, intervention services are often “siloed”: individuals with mental health needs are referred for mental health services, individuals with family conflict are referred for family-based treatment, etc. These treatment “silos” may miss the larger picture of the co-occurrence of risk, promotion, and the problems themselves. In a previous paper, we used latent class analysis to identify subgroups of individuals with crosscutting patterns (i.e., classes) of psychological and family maltreatment problems. In this study, we explored the predictors of these latent classes.Participants consisted of two large population samples of U.S. Air Force active duty members (ns = 27,895 and 30,841) who were married or cohabiting and had one or more children living in their household. Participants completed an anonymous community assessment survey, which included questionnaire items tapping personal, family, and community problems and well-being. Assessments were conducted in 2008 and 2011. All study procedures were approved by the authors’ Institutional Review Board. We used exploratory factor analysis and latent class analysis to (1) identify higher-order factors of risk and promotive variables and (2) examine them as predictors of our previously identified latent classes.Findings indicated that individuals who reported better physical well-being as well as personal and family coping, relationship satisfaction, and support were more likely to be in the lowest-risk subgroup. Notably, individuals in the subgroup most at risk for serious violence and suicide, evidencing disinhibitory psychopathology, endorsed lower risk and higher promotive factors than those individuals in other high-risk subgroups who fell along the internalizing/externalizing continuum.These findings reinforce the need for integrated prevention and treatment of psychological and family maltreatment problems. Not only do these problems often co-occur, but their risk and promotive factors also tend to be intertwined. The unique (i.e., not on the continuum of the other five classes) problem profile of participants evidencing disinhibitory psychopathology is matched by a unique risk/promotive factor profile, and they will thus likely require a unique intervention approach.",6/24/22,10/6/22 17:40,10/6/22 17:40,10/6/22 17:40,usac173,,,,,Military Medicine,,,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/CKW8FTN5/Nichols et al_2022_Predictors of Crosscutting Patterns of Psychological Health and Family.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/K5VJ2YN8/6617320.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach A survey design was performed to collect data from supply chain professionals regarding their organization’s supply chain orientation (SCO), organizational identification (OI) and achieved states of both internal and supplier integration. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling was performed to test the dual mediating pathways. Findings The results show that internal integration partially mediates relationships between SCO and supplier integration and for OI and supplier integration. In comparing the mediating effects to test competing theories, the SCO path yields stronger complementary partial mediation. This supports the proposition that SCO and OI mutually exist within an organization and influence achieved integrative behaviors. Additionally, results suggest the behavioral spillover effect exists for an internally integrated organization that has also achieved supplier integration. Originality/value This research makes several contributions to extant literature, including finding that SCO contributes to levels of achieved integration. Also, this research theoretically integrates literature on the social dilemma associated with supplier integration and the behavioral spillover effect, suggesting that SCO allows for positive internal integrative behaviors to spillover to integrated suppliers. Finally, this research contributes to research on OI by finding achieved integration is an outcome, which refutes a dominate theory that explains OI facilitates negative behaviors toward external organizations.",1/1/18,10/6/22 17:40,10/6/22 17:40,10/6/22 17:40,1306-1324,,4,29,,,Achieving integration,,,,,,,,,,,,Emerald Insight,,Publisher: Emerald Publishing Limited,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/GM8GYYBW/Robinson et al_2018_Achieving integration.pdf,,,North America; Structural equation modelling; Buyer-supplier relationships; Management research; Supply chain integration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our sample consisted of 657 workers (51% female) representing a variety of industries. As hypothesized, it is not high job demands per se, but high demands in combination with a high need for autonomy and a lack of perceived opportunities for blended working that undermines intrinsic work motivation. When workers high in need for autonomy perceived opportunities for blended working, their intrinsic work motivation was not negatively affected by increasing job demands. This main finding suggests that, particularly for workers high in need for autonomy, the perceived opportunity for blended working is an effective, contemporary resource to cope with the increasing job demands typically observed in today's workplace. Theoretically, these findings contribute to the refinement and extension of influential demands-resource models and Person-Job Fit theory.

Because of its primarily rewarding nature, IP is a predestinated target for addictive behaviors. However, not every user develops an unregulated usage pattern. In fact, most users tend to use IP recreationally. Impulsivity-related constructs have been identified as promoters of addictive behaviors. It is unclear whether these impulsivity-related constructs are specific for unregulated IP use or also play a role in recreational but frequent behaviors. In this study, we investigated impulsive tendencies (trait impulsivity, delay discounting, and cognitive style), craving toward IP, attitude regarding IP, and coping styles in individuals with recreational–occasional, recreational–frequent, and unregulated IP use. Methods A total of 1,498 heterosexual males participated in an online survey. Groups of individuals with recreational–occasional use (n = 333), recreational–frequent use (n = 394), and unregulated use (n = 225) of IP were identified by screening instruments. Results Craving and attitude regarding IP as well as delay discounting and cognitive and coping styles differed between groups. Individuals with unregulated use showed the highest scores for craving, attentional impulsivity, delay discounting, and dysfunctional coping, and lowest scores for functional coping and need for cognition. Recreational–frequent users had the most positive attitude toward IP. Motor and non-planning impulsivity did not differ between groups.

This dissertation examined a  specific individual difference in decision-making: decision-making anxiety. With the adoption of  a situation-specific approach, a series of three studies allowed for the conceptual definition of  this construct, the development of a measure, and the exploration of its role in the decisionmaking process. Study 1 focused on the development and validation of the Decision-Making  Anxiety Inventory. The results demonstrated that the 8-item scale is a useful measure of  decision-making anxiety, a superordinate construct, best understood by the interrelations of its  three factors of anxiety, worry, and emotionality. Moreover, this study situated decision-making  anxiety alongside existing decision-making and personality constructs. In Study 2, the  relationships between decision-making anxiety and objective and perceived decision-making  competence, and perceived decision quality were examined. This study also included crossvalidation from peers. Findings revealed that anxious decision-makers viewed themselves as  poor decision-makers who do not make quality decisions. This perception was not supported by  the results from objective measures, nor from peer ratings. In Study 3, the role of decisionmaking anxiety was explored in a specific decision-making context: job search. Data was  gathered at two time points, two months apart. This study investigated whether decision-making  anxiety led to poorer job choice outcomes, via its relationship with job search behaviours.  Results demonstrated that decision-making anxiety was a significant negative predictor of job  search effort and intensity, and the focused, exploratory, and haphazard job search strategies.  However, decision-making anxiety did not predict the more distal outcomes. Overall, this  dissertation highlights that decision-making anxiety is a relevant individual difference in decision-making, which appears to influence individuals’ perceptions about their decisionmaking skills, their experience of decision outcomes, and their decision-related behaviours",11/19/20,10/6/22 17:41,10/22/22 20:16,10/6/22 17:41,,,,,,,Decision-Making in Young Adults,,,,,,,en,,,,,ruor.uottawa.ca,,Accepted: 2020-11-19T20:36:15Z DOI: 10.20381/ruor-25690,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/44GA53EQ/Girard_2020_Decision-Making in Young Adults.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/IKGXRJXU/41466.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the technique has delivered promising results in terms of improved validity in survey studies of sensitive issues, recent studies have indicated that the crosswise model may sometimes produce false positives. Hence, we investigated whether an insufficient understanding of the crosswise model instructions might be responsible for these false positives and whether ensuring a deeper understanding of the model and surveying more highly educated respondents reduces the problem of false positives. To this end, we experimentally manipulated the amount of information respondents received in the crosswise model instructions. We compared a crosswise model condition with only brief instructions and a crosswise model condition with detailed instructions and additional comprehension checks. Additionally, we compared the validity of crosswise model estimates between a higher- and a lower-educated subgroup of respondents. Our results indicate that false positives among highly educated respondents can be reduced when detailed instructions and comprehension checks are employed. Since false positives can also occur in direct questioning, they do not appear to be a specific flaw of the crosswise model, but rather a more general problem of self-reports on sensitive topics. False negatives were found to occur for all questioning techniques, but were less prevalent in the crosswise model than in the direct questioning condition.

Researchers' attempts to unify PE fit theory have often yielded multidimensional, integrative models (Edwards & Billsberry, 2010; Jansen & Kristof-Brown, 2006; Seong & Kristof-Brown, 2012). This study compares multiple different approaches to creating a multidimensional, aggregate PE fit construct through different salience weighting methods. Formative modeling was tested because PE fit is well-suited to this modeling approach in which the subcomponents of the higher-order construct constitute the overall construct instead of being manifestations (indicators) of the latent construct. As well, previously attempted methods to derive salience weights for the subdimensions of PE fit were compared to novel methods that directly assess salience weights for PE fit on an individual-level. Finally, group-level methods based on a latent profile analysis were also investigated. Results showed that incorporation of individual-level salience weights did not significantly improve measurement of PE fit or the prediction of outcomes. As well, correlations obtained through sample-level weights (i.e., relative weights analysis) and group-level weights (i.e., latent profile analysis) did not significantly differ, thus simpler approaches are adequate. Finally, most individuals seem to weight all operationalizations of PE fit similarly.

Karwowski (2014) developed the Creative Mindsets Scale (CMS), in which fixed and growth creative mindsets were each measured with five items. Across three studies, the current study aimed to examine its psychometric properties in Chinese settings and to explore to what extent effects of creative mindsets on creativity were generalized to the real workplace. Based on the survey data of 216 college students (Study 1) and 205 full-time employees (Study 2) in China, results consistently indicated that a two-factor structure, in which both types of creative mindsets were independent of each other, was confirmed. Measures of both types of creative mindsets were of satisfactory psychometric features in terms of reliability (internal consistency) and validity (construct, convergent, and discriminant validities). Furthermore, Study 1 provided evidence for the incremental validity of creative mindsets beyond mindsets of intelligence in explaining creative personal identity and creative self-efficacy. Based on a third independent sample consisting of 282 full-time employees from several Chinese companies, Study 3 further demonstrated that measures of creative mindsets could predict employees’ creative performance as rated by their supervisors, lending additional support for their generalizability to the real workplace. Moreover, growth mindset, but not fixed mindset, was significantly related to creative performance, and such an effect was mediated by effort. The present study contributes to the creative mindset literature by cross-validating the CMS’s psychometric properties in a new setting and empirically establishing the link between creative mindsets and employees’ creativity in the real workplace.",2020,10/6/22 17:45,10/6/22 17:45,10/6/22 17:45,,,,11,,,Creative Mindsets,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/RPM75H3Y/Zhou et al_2020_Creative Mindsets.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Measures of forced-choice and single-stimulus interests, personality, general mental ability (GMA), and impression management (IM) were collected from 236 participants across honest and faked instructions. Findings suggest that individuals were capable of faking interest inventories, but surprisingly, the effect did not vary greatly as a function of format or scoring method.

The study randomized 170 participants to receive either a brief Standard Feedback Condition (SFC; n=83) or a Motives Feedback Condition (MFC; n=87) that added education and feedback on drinking to cope as well as alternative coping strategies. Significant reductions in drinking to cope with anxiety and with depression were greater in the MFC at the 2-month follow-up. Significant reductions in drinking and negative consequences were observed but did not differ significantly by condition. Indirect tests showed that the MFC, relative to SFC, was associated with outcomes of drinking and negative consequences through change in drinking to cope with depression.

We suggest that this inconsistency may be due to a lack of consideration of the fact that empathy has two facets: empathic concern, namely the compassion for unfortunate others, and personal distress, the experience of discomfort in response to others’ distress. We test the hypothesis that empathic concern is positively related to emotion recognition, whereas personal distress is negatively related to emotion recognition. Individual tendencies to respond with concern or distress were measured with the standard IRI (Interpersonal Reactivity Index) self-report questionnaire. Emotion recognition performance was assessed with three standard tests of nonverbal emotion recognition. Across two studies (total N = 431) anddifferent emotion recognition tests, we found that these two facets of affective empathy have opposite relations to recognition of facial expressions of emotions: empathic concern was positively related, while personal distress was negatively related, to accurate emotion recognition.

Psychotherapy is well-established as efficacious and cost effective in the treatment of mental health difficulties, particularly the widely-used family of cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT). The most prominent, new CBT—acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)–has shown efficacy equal to or better than traditional CBT across a range of such difficulties. ACT’s novel approach to language, defusion (the opposite of fusion), can help improve mental health by changing one’s relationship with their thoughts. Efforts to better understand this mechanism of ACT has been hampered by the absence of a robust fusion measure until recently, with the creation of the Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire (CFQ). The present study sought to confirm the psychometrics of the CFQ with a large adult undergraduate student sample from the U.S. and to further expand our empirical understanding of the relationship between fusion and other important clinical constructs. Results showed that the CFQ exhibited strong internal consistency reliability; a unidimensional factor structure; and construct, concurrent criterion, and incremental validity in relation to a number of other important clinical scales as predicted. However, the results also showed that the factor structure of the CFQ was shared with the predominant measure of the central ACT construct of psychological flexibility, implying the two are measuring the same underlying construct.

6ZT5HZ5A,journalArticle,2021,"Tsaousoglou, Kleopatra",Using psychometrics in human resource management in tourist accommodation: employees' predisposition for organizational turnover,Dissertations,,,,,"Tourism is highly important for the Greek economy. The tourism product consists mostly of services, something that highlights the crucial role of human factor in the tourism context. Employee turnover rates in tourism industry are considerably high globally, and the same applies to Greece. The main focus of literature, in terms of employee turnover, is based on environmental and situational reasons. In an effort to focus on reasons for employee turnover that are connected with individuals themselves and not with environmental and working conditions, the current dissertation investigates the causal relationship of personality and commitment with intention to leave an organization. More specifically the dissertation focuses on employees of the Greek accommodation sector, as this industry represents almost half of total tourism revenues. Taking into consideration that upon selection of new employees, the employee turnover process is possible to start, we focused on structured selection methods that could support selection process and improve selection decisions in terms of turnover. Thus, we focus on psychometric assessments which, according to corresponding literature, represent the most direct and cost-effective way to reduce turnover in a pre-entry stage. Psychometrics can pinpoint an applicant’s predisposition based on numbers and measures and not on subjective estimations, as is the case with unstructured interviews, which are the most commonly used selection methods. The aim of this dissertation is to evaluate personality and the work attitude of commitment as these features according to theory can affect behavior. As in corresponding literature the disposition of turnover behavior has rarely been examined, it was examined if personality can be an antecedent of turnover. In addition, as commitment is inextricably related with turnover, it has been examined if commitment has a dispositional aspect, as well. Finally, as research on commitment in terms of turnover has mostly focused on organizational commitment, the role of a different foci of commitment (occupational commitment) on turnover was examined in the context of hospitality, where evidence on the topic is scarce. Utilizing structural equation modelling (SEM), emotional stability, organizational commitment, and occupational commitment were found to be predictors of intention to leave organization. In addition, extraversion, agreeableness, emotional stability, and conscientiousness were found to be strongly related with organizational commitment. An additional impact of intention to leave occupation on prediction of organization commitment has also been observed. The practical and theoretical implications of these results are discussed as well.",9/28/21,10/6/22 17:46,10/22/22 17:14,,,,,,,,Using psychometrics in human resource management in tourist accommodation,,,,,,,,,,,,ResearchGate,,DOI: 10.12681/eadd/50336,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kleopatra-Tsaousoglou/publication/358770073_Using_psychometrics_in_human_resource_management_in_tourist_accommodation_employees'_predisposition_for_organizational_turnover/links/6214c9424be28e145caa0015/Using-psychometrics-in-human-resource-management-in-tourist-accommodation-employees-predisposition-for-organizational-turnover.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mesdaghinia and colleagues (2021) recently advanced the leader immorality encouragement (LIE) construct to address the pressure supervisors place on employees to engage in unethical behaviors that ostensibly benefit the organization. However, more research is needed to illuminate the extent of LIE’s nomological network. Therefore, the purpose of my dissertation was to (1) expand the criterion domain of LIE and (2) explore how outcome expectancies and ethical decision-making processes may mediate LIE’s detrimental effects onto employee outcomes. I collected longitudinal field survey data from 327 employees and 26 managers working in 28 Chinese hotels to investigate my hypotheses. I found that LIE had a positive total effect on unethical pro-organizational behavior (UPB) willingness using aggregated path analysis but no significant total effects on workplace cheating behaviors, extra-role performance, nor quitting cognitions. A supplementary analysis revealed that punishment apprehension was the focal mechanism that transferred LIE’s positive effects onto UPB willingness, workplace cheating behaviors, and quitting cognitions. There were no significant indirect effects through instrumentality, moral disengagement, nor supervisor-directed anger. These findings offer new insights for leadership theory by highlighting the importance of social learning and negative affective reactions to adverse outcome expectancies stemming from managers’ unethical directives.",8/5/21,10/6/22 17:46,10/22/22 20:11,10/6/22 17:46,,,,,,,Doing Bad for the Good of the Organization,,,,,,,en,,,,,uh-ir.tdl.org,,Accepted: 2022-06-18T02:04:39Z,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/STPKHNBM/Lewis_2021_Doing Bad for the Good of the Organization.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/JS4I7CWT/9326.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oftentimes companies have to devise tactics to encourage more social sharing of brand messages, such as through the use of incentives and rewards. Previous research has investigated incentive effects under the traditional offline context, which addresses mostly economic exchanges and fails to consider the social dynamics of the social media environment. Addressing this gap, this research aims to answer the following research question: how can companies target different consumers with different incentives to maximize consumer sharing through social media? Specifically, the present research proposes three factors that can affect the relative appropriateness of monetary versus non-monetary incentives in driving consumer sharing: consumer loyalty, audience size and brand personality. Three experimental studies were conducted to examine these factors. The findings of study 1 indicate that consumers with high loyalty are more likely to engage in social sharing when faced with non-monetary incentives. In contrast, non-loyal consumers are more likely to engage in social sharing when offered monetary incentives. Study 2 shows that non-monetary incentives are more effective when sharing to a wide audience is requested, but incentive type does not make a difference when sharing is limited to specific individuals. The results of Study 3 show that, for a brand characterized by sincerity, consumers are more likely to engage in social sharing when a non-monetary incentive is used than when a monetary incentive is used. For an “exciting” brand, the incentive type does not matter. By examining these moderators, this dissertation contributes to a better understanding of how to use incentives more appropriately to increase social sharing under different situations. Moreover, the research findings here can help marketers define the appropriate strategies to target different types of social interactions, and allow them to restore some control in the co-creation of brand stories in the social media context.",2016,10/6/22 17:46,10/22/22 19:10,10/6/22 17:46,,,,,,,Buying Love Through Social Media,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9781339860046 Publication Title: ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/YPRZVKDZ/Zou_2016_Buying Love Through Social Media.pdf,,,Marketing; Incentives; Social networks; Brand loyalty; Business administration; Consumers; Virtual communities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After completing the pretest, students (N = 401) were randomly assigned to a Mindfulness plus Present Control intervention, a Mindfulness only intervention, or a Stress-information only comparison group. Primary outcomes were stress, anxiety, depression, perceived stress and worry; hypothesized mediators of intervention efficacy were rumination, mindfulness and present control. Self-report measures were completed online at pre-intervention, post-intervention, first follow-up (2-3 weeks postintervention) and second follow-up (4-5 weeks postintervention). Ninety percent of the sample (n = 365) completed the pretest and comprised the intent-to-treat sample. Linear mixed modeling was used to assess significant change over time and hierarchical regression was used to test for mediation. Participants in all three groups reported significant decreases in all five primary outcomes across all time points (within group d’s = -.15 to -.56). All time by intervention group interaction effects were non-significant suggesting that the three conditions were equally effective. With regard to the mediators, participants reported significant increases in present control and mindfulness and significant decreases in rumination from baseline to post-intervention and both follow-ups (within group d’s = .01 to .71). There was one significant time by intervention group interaction effect in the analyses assessing change over time in the mediators specifically indicating a between-group difference in changes in rumination, F(8, 973) = 3.73, p = .0003. In this case, the Mindfulness plus Present Control group reduced rumination significantly more than the comparison group. Because there were few differences across conditions, mediation analyses were performed collapsing across conditions. In general, changes in present control were associated with changes in depression and changes in rumination were associated with changes in worry and perceived stress at the second follow-up controlling for baseline scores.

Conclusions: Use of the REAR may enable researchers and clinicians to examine how people of color proactively respond to racism through empowered action to challenge racism, and how these responses may moderate the negative effects of racism on psychological well-being.

Alternatively, there is a dearth of published empirical research that investigates whether there are profiles, or types, of counterproductive employees – a so-called person-centered approach. This study addressed that gap by conducting latent profile analysis on a sample of employees (N = 522) from various organizations to examine a number of research questions involving the existence, distribution, and shape of CWB profiles, and the relationships between profiles and dark triad traits and previous work (disciplined or fired) and nonwork (arrested) experiences. Collectively, results supported a four-profile solution with statistically significant differences between profiles on most study variables. Further, the findings of this person-centered approach fit with extant variable-centered CWB research and complement that research by identifying subgroups of counterproductive employees. Implications for scientists’ conceptual understanding of counterproductivity and applied interventions aimed at reducing CWBs are discussed, alongside recommendations for future person-centered research on CWB.",,10/6/22 17:46,10/22/22 19:49,10/6/22 17:46,,,,,,,Examination of Employee Deviance Patterns,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9781392862209,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/C44WJQXA/Travis_Examination of Employee Deviance Patterns.pdf,,,Counterproductive work behaviors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using intensive longitudinal data, we analyzed whether daily stress had an indirect effect on sleep quality through calmness in the evening, and we tested whether NED moderated this within-person indirect effect by buffering the link between daily stress and calmness in the evening. A non-representative community sample (n = 313, 15–82 years old) participated in a 21-day ambulatory assessment with twice-daily surveys. The results of multilevel mediation models showed that higher daily stress was related to within-day change in calmness from morning to evening, resulting in less calmness in the evening within persons. Less calmness in the evening, in turn, was related to poorer nightly sleep quality within persons. As expected, higher NED predicted a less negative within-person link between daily stress and calmness in the evening, thereby attenuating the indirect effect of daily stress on nightly sleep quality through calmness. This effect held when we controlled for mean negative emotions and depression.

Hence, a central question in the literature is how to enhance employees’ proactive behavior. We investigated whether the more that employees experience a sense of vitality (i.e., energizing positive affect), the more likely they are to show proactive behavior at work, and whether this applies only to employees with a low personal fear of invalidity [(PFI) i.e., the inclination to be apprehensive about the risks/negative consequences of making errors]. Experimental (N = 354) and cross-sectional field (N = 85) studies provided consistent evidence for a positive relation between employees’ sense of vitality at work and their self-rated proactivity. The predicted moderation effect was observed only for manager-rated proactivity. We conclude that feeling energized in the workplace is not necessarily associated with observable proactive behavior.

We reasoned that more independence across valences (e.g., enthusiastic-upset) and within valence (e.g., distressed-afraid) would represent a more adaptive affective structure characterized by greater emotion differentiation. The network structure was expected to vary as a function of effortful control and reactivity. We hypothesized effortful control would be associated with weaker associations between and within emotional valences and reactivity would be associated with stronger associations between and within emotional valences (less complexity). Hypotheses were partially supported in a cross-sectional study of 403 young adults. Findings indicated that low effortful control (e.g., low planning and problem solving) was related to stronger associations between emotional valences and reactivity (e.g., impulsivity, distractibility) was associated with stronger associations between negative emotions. This pattern of findings is consistent with a conceptualization of self-regulation characterized by more complex and unique emotional experiences.

Nevertheless, evidence supporting this claim has remained elusive. In five studies (N = 1,225), we disentangle how grandiose narcissism predicts divergent envious inclinations. Specific facets of narcissism and forms of envy shared the same underlying motivational orientations (Study 1) and distinctively related to each other (Studies 1 to 5) via differences in emotional appraisal (Study 4). Moreover, envy was linked to opposing social consequences of different narcissism facets (Study 5). Specifically, hope for success related to narcissistic admiration, predicting benign envy, which entails the motivation to improve performance, translating into the ascription of social potency by the self and others. In contrast, fear of failure related to narcissistic rivalry, predicting malicious envy, which entails hostility, translating into the ascription of a proneness for social conflict by others. These results converged with envy measured as a trait (Studies 1 and 5) or state in recall tasks (Studies 2 and 4) and as response to an upward standard in the situation (Study 3).

Drawing from the social functional view of emotions and emerging research on attributed motives of abusive supervision, we examine this phenomenon, which we refer to as the whiplash effect—the notion that subordinates may display different emotional and behavioral reactions to supervisory abuse depending on their attributions for abuse. We conduct 3 studies to examine this effect at both the between- and within person level. Results from a multisource, time-lagged field study (between-person) and a laboratory-based experiment (between-person) indicate that when subordinates believe that the abusive supervisor is motivated by desires to cause harm (i.e., injury initiation attribution is higher), abusive supervision is more likely to engender anger, which, in turn, elicits more deviant behaviors and fewer organizational citizenship behaviors; however, when subordinates believe the abusive supervisor is motivated by desires to improve performance (i.e., performance promotion attribution is higher), abusive supervision is more likely to evoke guilt, which, in turn, elicits fewer deviant behaviors and more organizational citizenship behaviors. These results were then expanded in an experience sampling study (within-person), which allowed us to further examine how general interpretations of supervisors’ motives behind abusive supervision shape employees’ momentary emotional and behavioral responses toward daily abusive supervisor behavior. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

Studies have identified several correlates and risk factors pertaining to the type of aggression used (i.e., physical or relational) in either peer or dating/romantic relationships. Specifically, there are social-cognitive (e.g., normative beliefs about aggression), affective (e.g., emotional dysregulation), and personality variables (e.g., callous-unemotional traits) that have been identified as placing individuals at greater risk of engagement in aggression. However, associations between risk factors, subtypes of aggression, and relationship context have rarely been examined within a single study. It is important to do so to examine whether there is an underlying risk profile that that can be useful in predicting aggression regardless of the type of relationship. We investigated these associations among a subset of one hundred and forty-seven college students, aged 18–25, who participated in a larger study. We used several measures to assess important theoretical correlates, including exclusivity beliefs, normative beliefs about aggression, rumination, emotional dysregulation, and callous-unemotional (CU) traits. Path analysis revealed that peer relational and peer physical aggression were predicted by peer exclusivity, normative beliefs about aggression, and callous-unemotional traits.

That is, leader’s social accounts may reframe or reconstrue subordinates’ unethical conduct such that it appears less reprehensible. We predict observers will respond negatively to leaders when they use moral disengagement language within social accounts and, specifically, observers will ostracize these leaders. In addition, we predict that observer moral disengagement propensity moderates this effect, such that the relationship between leaders’ use of moral disengagement language within a social account and ostracism is stronger when observer moral disengagement propensity is lower versus higher. Finally, we predict that the reason why observers ostracize the leader is because observers perceive the leader’s social account with moral disengagement language as unethical. Thus, perceived leader social account ethicality is predicted to mediate the interaction effect of leader’s use of moral disengagement language within social accounts and observer moral disengagement propensity on ostracism. Results from an experiment and field study support our predictions. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

However, few studies have considered specific relationships with functional subtypes of aggression, or how gender and anger rumination affect these relationships in emerging adulthood. We hypothesized that primary psychopathy would be uniquely related to proactive aggression (PA) and secondary psychopathy to reactive aggression (RA), and that these relationships would be amplified by anger rumination, and potentially influenced further by gender. Undergraduate students (N = 610; 73.3 % female) ages 18–20 completed self-report measures of anger rumination, psychopathy, and aggression, and hypotheses were tested using hierarchical regression. As predicted, anger rumination enhanced the association between secondary psychopathy and RA. It also amplified the relationship between primary psychopathy and PA, but only at very high levels of anger rumination. Gender moderated interactions between primary and secondary psychopathy on aggression. For men, primary psychopathy attenuated the secondary psychopathy – RA relationship, but not for women. These findings fill an important gap in the literature by demonstrating how tendencies to ruminate on anger and psychopathic traits interact to influence functional subtypes of aggression in young men versus women.",3/1/17,10/6/22 17:52,10/6/22 17:52,10/6/22 17:52,35-45,,1,39,,J Psychopathol Behav Assess,Psychopathy and Functions of Aggression in Emerging Adulthood,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/WT7UTYTN/Guerra_White_2017_Psychopathy and Functions of Aggression in Emerging Adulthood.pdf,,,Aggression; Psychopathy; Gender; Moderation; Anger rumination,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research on antisocial behavior typically focuses on either individual or environmental risk factors, rarely integrating risks across levels of analysis. Although low objective SES is clearly associated with antisocial behavior, the reasons why are unclear. Sociological theories suggest this relationship is due to neighborhood and environmental characteristics that create social disorganization and reduce informal social controls in the community. On the other hand, psychological theories suggest that elevated levels of psychological distress and psychopathic traits may influence individual risk for antisocial behavior.    The purpose of this study was to integrate sociological and psychological models to examine how certain individual and environmental risk factors intersect in predicting antisocial behavior. In a demographically diverse adult male sample (N = 462), environmental (neighborhood distress) and individual (psychological distress) risk factors each mediated the SES – antisocial behavior relationship (as predicted), although findings depended on which definition of SES was used (objective versus subjective). In addition, psychopathic dimensions (specifically, meanness and disinhibition) were observed to exacerbate the effects of neighborhood and psychological distress on antisocial behavior, as hypothesized. Supplemental analyses also considered index variables comprising neighborhood disadvantage.     Overall, results of this study help inform psychological and sociological theories of antisocial behavior, and may assist in clarifying potential neighborhood- and individual-level foci for interventions to prevent and reduce antisocial behavior in the community.",5/3/18,10/6/22 17:52,10/22/22 17:11,10/6/22 17:52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,In Copyright,,,,vtechworks.lib.vt.edu,,Accepted: 2018-05-04T08:00:28Z Artwork Medium: ETD Interview Medium: ETD Publisher: Virginia Tech,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/4E8B9DYJ/Guerra_2018_Psychological and Sociological Mechanisms Linking Low SES and Antisocial.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/PUBU39MP/82977.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stigma may prevent medical students from seeking psychological help when experiencing distress, which may hinder their job performance and mental health. Compassionate values—preferred principles that guide attitudes and behaviors to focus on the wellness of others—may be a relevant predictor of medical students’ perceptions of psychological help. The present study examined the association between medical students’ compassionate values, help-seeking stigma, and help-seeking attitudes in a convenience sample of medical students. Hypotheses: Rating compassionate values as more important than self-interested values will be associated with less stigma, which in turn will be associated with more positive help-seeking attitudes. Method: There were 220 medical students in their 2nd year of medical training who were recruited in-class and through e-mail between January and March of 2017 at Des Moines University.

Design A mixed-methods study was conducted, employing (1) semistructured interviews, (2) an online survey and (3) triangulation of findings. Participants 524 dermatologists and rheumatologists entered the study; 495 completed it; 388 met inclusion criteria for analysis. Participants were included if actively practising in Germany (GER), the UK or the USA; had a minimum 5% caseload of female patients of reproductive age with either axial spondyloarthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis; and had experience prescribing biologics. Results 48 interviews and 340 surveys were analysed. Interviews underscored dermatologists and rheumatologists’ suboptimal integration of SDM in clinical practice. In the survey, 90% (n=305) did not know about SDM models. A perceived lack of competency counselling patients on pregnancy and family planning was also identified during interviews. Among the survey sample, 44% (n=150) of specialists agreed they preferred leaving pregnancy-related discussions to obstetricians and/or gynaecologists and 57% (n=189) reported having suboptimal skills discussing contraceptive methods with patients. Another finding that emerged from interviews was the perception that all biologics are strictly contraindicated during pregnancy. Suboptimal knowledge was noted among 57% (n=95) of dermatologists and 48% (n=83) of rheumatologists surveyed in that regard, with a statistically significant difference by country among dermatologists (GER: 42% vs UK: 71% vs USA: 57%, p=0.015).

To date, no study has evaluated the impact of vaccine conspiracy beliefs on human papillomavirus vaccine acceptance. The authors assessed the validity of a Vaccine Conspiracy Beliefs Scale (VCBS) and determined whether this scale was associated with parents’ willingness to vaccinate their son with the HPV vaccine. Methods Canadian parents completed a 24-min online survey in 2014. Measures included socio-demographic variables, HPV knowledge, health care provider recommendation, Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire (CMQ), the seven-item VCBS, and parents’ willingness to vaccinate their son at two price points. Results A total of 1427 Canadian parents completed the survey in English (61.2%) or French (38.8%). A Factor Analysis revealed the VCBS is one-dimensional and has high internal consistency (α=0.937). The construct validity of the VCBS was supported by a moderate relationship with the CMQ (r=0.44, p<0.001). Hierarchical regression analyses found the VCBS is negatively related to parents’ willingness to vaccinate their son with the HPV vaccine at both price points (‘free’ or ‘$300′) after controlling for gender, age, household income, education level, HPV knowledge, and health care provider recommendation. Conclusions The VCBS is a brief, valid scale that will be useful in further elucidating the correlates of vaccine hesitancy.

After performing both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, we identified a 16-item scale consisting of four sub-scales that measures attitudes towards choosing passwords, device securement, staying up-to-date, and proactive awareness.",4/18/15,10/6/22 17:53,10/6/22 17:53,10/6/22,2873–2882,,,,,,Scaling the Security Wall,CHI '15,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/5XYB7AMK/Egelman_Peer_2015_Scaling the Security Wall.pdf,,,psychometrics; individual differences; security behavior,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5XMCAZWT,journalArticle,,"Perez, Samara","Parents' Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Decision-Making: Theory, Measurement and Models",Dissertations,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/2509520860/abstract/7B9840705DA04046PQ/1,"The human papillomavirus (HPV) infects approximately 550,000 Canadians annually. Cancers of the cervix, mouth, genitals, anus, head and neck are caused by various strains of the HPV. The HPV also causes genital warts. The disease and economic burden of HPV infections is high. Three HPV vaccines are available: Cervarix®, Gardasil®, and Gardasil® 9. Consistent with global practices in developed countries, these vaccines are currently publicly funded for girls and provided in school-based programs in all provinces and territories in Canada. As of September 2016, six provinces provide publicly funded school-based programs for boys. Despite welldocumented vaccine efficacy and effectiveness with minimal adverse effects, uptake of the HPV vaccines remains suboptimal in most countries, including Canada. Although HPV immunization rates have increased over the last decade, they remain significantly below the rates of other vaccine-preventable diseases. One of the main challenges for boys’ uptake has been to help parents understand that the HPV vaccine is now available, recommended and effective for boys in reducing health risks for themselves and transmission to their partners. With low HPV uptake rates in Canada, success of increased vaccination rates is contingent on parents’ awareness, understanding and ultimately their decision-making process. Of the HPV vaccination research that has targeted parents of boys, most studies examined demographic and descriptive factors associated with vaccination intentions. While this research is informative, it treats decision-making as binary, when there are likely multiple stages of vaccination decision-making. Conceptualizing vaccine decision-making as distinct stages would allow us to examine those individuals who are vaccine hesitant, as well as parents who are not yet aware or engaged in HPV vaccine decision-making. Moreover, much of the existing research on the correlates and factors associated with vaccination intentions are unreliable, which is likely due to differences in the conceptualization of the factors and inconsistent and unstable measures. This in turn provides limited insight about leverage points of how to move individuals along the HPV vaccine decision-making trajectory and ultimately increase HPV vaccine uptake. This dissertation addresses some of these research gaps by using theory-based research, as well as the development of two psychometrically validated scales, an extended HPV and HPV vaccine knowledge scale and the HPV Attitudes and Beliefs Scale (HABS) to identify the factors that are associated with HPV vaccination decision-making among a nationally representative sample of Canadian parents of 9-16-year-old boys using a longitudinal design. The unique contributions of the four manuscripts in this thesis are that by conceptualizing HPV vaccine decision-making as a series of distinct stages, by using theory, psychometrically-tested and validated measures, as well as multinomial logistic regression models, we can have a greater understanding about what influences parents’ HPV vaccine decision-making for their sons. This more nuanced understanding will help to better target our efforts to increase HPV vaccine uptake for boys. Future research directions and recommendations for better informed and targeted interventions are made. Alternate abstract: Le virus du papillome humain (VPH) infecte environ 550, 000 Canadiens chaque année. Les cancers de col du l'utérus, de la bouche, des organes génitaux, l'anus, de tête et cou sont causées par diverses types du VPH. Le VPH provoque également des condylomes génitales. La maladie et le fardeau économique de VPH est élevé. Trois vaccins sont disponibles, Cervarix®, Gardasil®, Gardasil® 9. En accord avec les pratiques internationales dans les pays développés, ces vaccins sont actuellement financés publiquement pour les filles et fournis à l’école dans des programmes d’immunisation dans toutes les provinces et territoires au Canada. En septembre 2016, six provinces fournissent maintenant à l'école des programmes d’immunisation gratuite pour les garçons. Malgré l'efficacité des vaccins bien documenté et l'efficacité avec un minimum d'effets secondaires, le taux d’immunisation contre le VPH reste faible dans la plupart des pays, incluant le Canada. Bien que les taux de vaccination contre le VPH ont augmenté au cours de la dernière décennie, ils restent nettement en dessous du taux d'autres maladies évitables par la vaccination. L'un des principaux défis pour les garçons a été d’aider les parents et les adultes à comprendre que le vaccin contre le VPH est maintenant disponible, efficace et recommandé pour les garçons pour la reduction du risque de l’infection pour eux-mêmes et la transmission aux partners. Avec un faible taux de la vaccination du VPH au Canada, le succès de l'augmentation des taux de vaccination est dépendant sur la sensibilisation et la compréhension des parents et, finalement, leurs processus de décision. Parmi la recherche sur la vaccination contre le VPH dans la population des parents des garçons, la plupart des études examine les facteurs démographiques et descriptives associées aux intentions de vaccination. Bien que cette recherche est informatif, il permet de traiter la prise de décisions en tant que binaire, quand il y a probablement plusieurs étapes de la prise de décisions de vaccination. La conceptualisation de la prise de décision comme des étapes nous permettrait d'examiner ceux qui sont hésitants de vaccins, ainsi que les parents qui ne sont pas au courant ou engagés dans leur processus de prise de décisions. Aussi, la majeure des recherches sur les corrélats et les facteurs associés à la vaccination intentions sont variables, ce qui est probablement dû aux différences dans la différente conceptualisation des facteurs et les mesures instables. Cela donne un aperçu limité sur les points de levage que on doit adresser pour bouger les personnes sur la trajectoire de prendre leurs décisions, et en fin, de se faire vacciner. Cette thèse aborde certaines de ces lacunes de recherche en utilisant la recherche fondée sur la théorie ainsi que la développement de deux échelles validées sur ces propriétaires psychométrique : une échelle du connaissance sur le VPH et une échelle des attitudes et croyances du VPH (HABS) pour identifier les facteurs associés à la prise de décisions pour la vaccination contre le VPH chez les parents garçons de 9-16 ans au Canada. Le caractère unique des quatres articles de cette thèse sont: de démontrer que le vaccin contre le VPH constitue la prise de décisions de plusieurs étapes, et qu'en utilisant la théorie et des mesures validées, ainsi que des modèles multinomiaux, nous pouvons avoir une plus bon compréhension de les facteurs qui influencent la prise de décisions pour les parents des fils. Cette compréhension plus nuancée aidera à mieux cibler les efforts d’augmenter le taux de vaccination contre le VPH pour les garçons. Des directions de la recherche et des recommandations pour améliorer l'information et des interventions ciblées sont effectuées.",,10/6/22 17:53,10/22/22 19:50,10/6/22 17:53,,,,,,,Parents' Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Decision-Making,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798582588078,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/RR62QNYM/Perez_Parents' Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Decision-Making.pdf,,,Human papillomavirus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I hypothesized that most students with a history of childhood maltreatment would display resilience in the domains of functioning, both cross-sectionally and across time, though more students without a history of childhood maltreatment would be categorized as resilient. I also hypothesized that current stressors would moderate the relation between childhood maltreatment and functioning as a risk factor, whereas emotion regulation, meaning-making, and social support would buffer the relations between childhood maltreatment and functioning. Participants and Methods: Data were collected at two time points from undergraduate students at the beginning (N = 312) and end (N = 241) of the semester. Results: The majority of students with low and moderate-to-severe childhood maltreatment were resilient in most domains at both time points and across time. For relational functioning and psychological functioning, the proportion of students with histories of maltreatment who were resilient was significantly different than those without at Time 1. Recent stressors, emotion regulation, meaning-making, and social support did not moderate the relation between maltreatment and any outcome. Conclusions: Research on maltreatment in undergraduate college students needs to acknowledge resilience, as many students with histories of maltreatment display resilient functioning.

The construct is defined as preferences about how society should be organized, how power in society should be allocated, the goals that society should aim to achieve, and the methods by which to achieve those goals. Political viewpoints relate to various human behaviors, including those relevant to a workplace setting. An item pool consisting of 262 items was generated and administered to two samples. The two samples were collected simultaneously and mirrored the United States electorate. The first sample consisted of 767 participants, and the second sample consisted of 762 participants. The results of an exploratory factor analysis indicated that the items were consistent with a four-factor solution. A confirmatory factor analysis on a separate cross validation sample confirmed this pattern. The final PVS consists of 24 items measuring four dimensions of political viewpoints: Collective, Accountability, Religiosity, and Security (CARS). This four-factor solution supports a multidimensional understanding of political viewpoints, which is more nuanced than the common conceptualization of political viewpoints falling on a liberal to conservative continuum. An assessment of convergent and discriminant validity offered additional validity evidence for the PVS. For example, convergent results indicated that Religiosity correlated significantly with the conventional sub facet of Right-Wing Authoritarianism (r = .72, p < .0001) and the Intrinsic sub facet of Age Universal Religious Orientation (r = .72, p < .0001). There were also scales that showed no significant relationship with any of the political viewpoints sub facets, providing evidence of discriminant validity. Age Universal Religious Orientation (Intrinsic) had no significant relationship with the Collective dimension. Openness to experience and risk of future events had no relationship with the Security and Religiosity dimensions. Conscientiousness and Neuroticism had no relationship with the Accountability dimension, and Neuroticism had no relationship with Religiosity. This research provides an impactful contribution to the space of politics and psychology in that it provides support for the idea political viewpoints exist within a person in a multidimensional and multifaceted manner. This research enables us to measure political viewpoints in a way that allows multiple viewpoints to exist within a person at one time. This provides a new and unique way to measure political viewpoints for Americans.",,10/6/22 17:53,10/22/22 19:12,10/6/22 17:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798678195180,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/GAKGP27K/Sall_Development of a Political Viewpoints Scale.pdf,,,Human behavior; Political viewpoints scale; Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed new faking warnings that leverage accountability and morality theory to reduce applicant faking. Accordingly, we examined the efficacy of our faking warnings in reducing applicant faking in one applied sample. We examined 534 mTurk participants who believed they were being considered for a real employment opportunity for a remote customer service position. Compared to participants not interested in the job, participants who were interested in the job had significantly more favorable personality scores. After informing participants that the position was fictitious and asking them to fill out the same personality measure as honestly as possible, the same previously interested participants received significantly less favorable personality scores.

Hand-held devices such as smartphones enable the participants in EMA studies to respond to the prompted assessments or self-initiate the assessments in real time. Besides conventional hand-held devices, wearable devices, e.g., actigraphy, have enabled more accurate and intensive tracking of subject's behaviors such as physical activities (PA). Relevant statistical methods for intensive longitudinal data analysis are continuing to be developed, however challenges remain such as modeling of the complex multilevel serial correlation in the data, informative nonresponses in self-initiated assessments, and identical data entries and also the irregularly distributed PA data. In this thesis, extended methods specifically for deal with the above mentioned issues were proposed. First, during EMA studies, subjects can receive prompted assessments intensively across days and within each day, which results in three-level longitudinal data, e.g., subject-level (level-3), day-level nested in subject (level-2) and assessment-level nested in each day (level-1). Given the three-level EMA data, we proposed a linear mixed effects model with autocorrelated random effects at day-level and assessment-level. And with real time stamps of the assessments, we also provided a useful extension of this proposed model to deal with irregularly-spaced EMA assessments. Second, we addressed the issue of non-responsivity of self-initiated assessments in EMA studies, where subjects are instructed to self-initiate reports when experiencing defined events, e.g., smoking. The frequency and determinants of non-responses in these event reports is usually unknown and these non-responses can even be associated with the primary longitudinal EMA outcome (e.g., mood) in which case a joint modeling of the non-responsitivity and the mood outcome is possible. In certain EMA studies, random prompts, distinct from the self-initiated reports, may be converted to event reports, which provide some information about the subject's non-responsivity of event reporting. Using such data, we proposed a shared-parameter location-scale model to link the primary outcome model for mood and a model for subjects’ non-responsivity by shared random effects which characterize a subject’s mood change pattern and mood variability. Third, for application of the MELS model, a problem that occurs is when subjects provide identical responses and therefore exhibit almost zero variance in their responses. It is assumed that certain latent clustering may exist to distinguish those who displayed different variance patterns. To deal with this, we assumed a mixture of normal distributions for scale random effects. For estimation, we incorporated Maximize-A-Posteriori (MAP) algorithm into the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm framework so that we can estimate the posterior probability of clustering membership for each subject. Lastly, to model the intensive irregularly distributed PA counts, we proposed a negative binomial mixed effects location-scale model (NBLS) to model these intensive longitudinal PA counts and to account for the heterogeneity in both the mean and dispersion level across subjects. Further, to handle the issue of inflated numbers of zeros in the PA data, we also proposed a hurdle/zero-inflated version which additionally includes the modeling of the probability of having non-zero PA levels.",2021,10/6/22 17:53,10/22/22 20:03,10/6/22 17:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798516959516,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/ZMPQZWEQ/Ma_Link to external site_2021_Extensions to Statistical Methods for Analyzing Intensive Multilevel.pdf,,,Ecological Momentary Assessments; Intensive Longitudinal Data; Mixed Effect Location-Scale Model; Mobile Health; Wearable devices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While existing works have used various proxies to infer user expectations (e.g., by analyzing app descriptions), how real-world users perceive an app's data access when they interact with graphical user interfaces (UI) has not been fully explored. In this paper, we aimed to fill this gap by directly measuring how end-users perceive app behaviors based on graphical UI elements via extensive user studies. The results are used to build an automated tool - GUIBAT (Graphical User Interface Behavioral Analysis Tool) - that detects sensitive resource accesses that violate user expectations. We conducted three user studies in total (N=904). The first two user studies were used to build a semantic mapping between user expectations of sensitive resource accesses and the common graphical UI elements (N=459). The third user study (N=445) was used to validate the performance of GUIBAT in predicting user expectations. By comparing user expectations and the actual app behavior (inferred by static program analysis) for 47,909 Android apps, we found that 75.38% of the apps have at least one unexpected sensitive resource access in which third-party libraries attributed to 46.13%. Our analysis lays a concrete foundation for modeling user expectations based on UI elements.

Modern conceptualizations define psychopathy as a multifaceted and dimensional construct that includes atypical experience of affect, interpersonal problems, and remarkable social deviance. Attentional differences and deficient emotional experience have been shown to predict psychopathy and other outcomes related to the construct. However, attentional and emotional functioning in individuals high in psychopathy is complex and results have been shown to vary across discrete emotion states and experimental paradigms. The negative preception hypothesis (Kosson et al. 2018) suggests that these differences may be the result of regulation of attention away from emotional experience as opposed to a general diminished emotional responsiveness, resulting in poor establishment of affect – consequence relationships and an overall impoverished emotional life. Deficits in tuning into nonverbal cues (TINC) and tuning out nonverbal cues (TONC) did not predict scores on an interview-based measure of psychopathy (PCL:SV). However, exploratory analyses with a self-report measure of psychopathy (TriPM) suggest deficits in these skills may be relevant in the context of alternate models of psychopathy. These results highlight the importance of accurately defining and understanding the heterogeneous construct of psychopathy and suggest that an inability to modulate attention toward or away from nonverbal emotional cues may exhibit distinct relationships with differing phenotypic components of the construct. Specifically, deficits relating to tuning into emotional cues may speak to an adaptive element of boldness in the triarchic psychopathy conceptualization while performance related to tuning out nonverbal cues was inversely related with a scale measure of meanness, callousness, and aggression.",2021,10/6/22 17:53,10/22/22 20:08,10/6/22 17:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798759956426,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/7FR7NY2G/Webb_2021_The Role of Emotional Attention Regulation in High Psychopathy Incarcerated.pdf,,,Attention; Psychopathy; Emotion regulation; Incarcerated; Emotion attention regulation; PCL:SV,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was hypothesized that AE would show significant fluctuations over the measurement period, and that higher levels of each form of entitlement would result in decreased levels of the aforementioned variables. Individuals with high levels of each type of entitlement were also expected to make more other-blame attributions following a failure, and more self-credit attributions following a success. To assess these hypotheses, students were evaluated three times over the course of one semester. Although there was no mean change in AE across the semester, there were significant individual differences in the amount and direction of change. Daily hassles significantly influenced this variability, and individuals with higher AE showed more variability than those with lower AE. Both AE and PE were negatively associated with effort, but only AE was negatively related to student performance. Although most of the effects of AE and PE on health and happiness were non-significant, they were in the anticipated direction. The analyses regarding attributions uncovered an unexpected pattern of results. The results from supplemental mediation analyses are encouraging in that they suggest potential targets for interventions aimed at reducing entitlement or mitigating its effects. These targets include perceived stress, academic self-efficacy, and scholastic effort.

These criteria may also be applied to other potential specific Internet-use disorders, which may be classified in ICD-11 as other disorders due to addictive behaviors, such as online buying-shopping disorder, online pornography-use disorder, social-networks-use disorder, and online gambling disorder. Due to the heterogeneity in existing instruments, we aimed to develop a consistent and economic measure of major types of (potential) specific Internet-use disorders based on ICD-11 criteria for gaming disorder. Methods The new 11-item Assessment of Criteria for Specific Internet-use Disorders (ACSID-11) measures five behavioral addictions with the same set of items by following the principles of WHO’s ASSIST. The ACSID-11 was administered to active Internet users (N = 985) together with an adaptation of the Ten-Item Internet Gaming Disorder Test (IGDT-10) and screeners for mental health. We used Confirmatory Factor Analyses to analyze the factor structure of ACSID-11. Results The assumed four-factorial structure was confirmed and was superior to the unidimensional solution.

As such, this study sheds light on the question: what influences the use of sustainable information and the decision to invest in a sustainable company by non-professional investors? In order to answer the question, this article builds on the behavioral finance and information overload literature. We used an online survey carried out in Germany and applied a structural equation model. The results show that the personal orientation toward sustainability issues is the most important factor in deciding to use a company’s sustainability information. Furthermore, the study reveals that the decision to invest in a sustainable company is influenced by the personal sustainability orientation, identification induced by a good feeling, their willingness to waive returns for sustainability, their exposure to sustainability information, the investor’s age and information overload. The results show that non-professional investors do not distinguish between the different aspects of sustainability, that is, ESG. The study contributes to research which explores decision-making of non-professional investors, specifically their perception of sustainability information.

In response to well-documented criticisms of assessing cultural values as aggregates measured at the nation level, this study examines the effects of value orientation measured at the individual level. Using survey data from U.S. consumers, the study shows that cultural values influence consumers' perceptions of the usability, uniqueness, quality, and social luxury values. Self-enhancement and social luxury values are the key drivers of consumers' proclivity for luxury consumption. A post hoc analysis reveals four luxury consumers groups: “unconcerned,” “functionalists,” “moderately-eager,” and “luxury-enthusiasts.” People with high self-enhancement and self-transcendence values are more likely to be luxury-enthusiasts, whereas functionalists and unconcerned share similar cultural value profiles. Luxury-enthusiasts have the highest proclivity for luxury consumption, followed by moderates and functionalists.

It has been suggested that the concept of socio-moral climate (SMC) might be particularly useful for understanding how participative organizational structures and processes shape employees’ prosocial behaviors. While SMC has been shown to be positively related to employees’ prosocial behaviors within the work context, little is known about the potential spillover effects of SMC (i.e., associations between SMC and employees’ prosocial behaviors outside the work context). The present study aims to address this gap by investigating how and why SMC is related to employees’ socially responsible purchase intention. Drawing on the relational job design framework, we argue that employees’ perceptions of their social impact may explain why SMC is positively related to responsible purchase intentions. We collected data from 492 employees working in various industries at two measurement points with a time lag of 12 months. Hypotheses were tested using path analysis, in which we controlled for the temporal stability of the study variables. The results showed that SMC was positively related to perceived social impact and socially responsible purchase intention and that perceived social impact was positively related to socially responsible purchase intention. In addition, we found a significant indirect relationship between SMC and socially responsible purchase intention through perceived social impact. The findings provide initial support for the spillover of employees’ work-related experiences onto their responsible purchase intentions within the nonwork domain. This study contributes to the literature by extending the traditional focus of SMC research on the development of moral reasoning skills to suggest that perceived social impact is an important mechanism underlying the relationship between SMC and prosocial behaviors. In terms of practical implications, this study suggests that organizational interventions designed to increase SMC may enhance employees’ perceptions of their social impact.",2021,10/6/22 17:58,10/6/22 17:58,10/6/22 17:58,,,,12,,,The Spillover of Socio-Moral Climate in Organizations Onto Employees’ Socially Responsible Purchase Intention,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/JJGBQGHE/Schümann et al_2021_The Spillover of Socio-Moral Climate in Organizations Onto Employees’ Socially.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although there is an increasing use of online surveys to investigate health outcomes, the limits of inference due to drug availability have not been studied. The goal of this study was to quantify the relationship between dispensing of prescription drugs and estimates of use in an online general population survey. Methods An online repeated, cross-sectional survey from 2018 to 2020 was used to estimate the number of adults in the United States who used prescription drugs in the general population and compared to estimated number of prescriptions dispensed over an equivalent time period. Joinpoint regression was used to quantify thresholds. A sample of respondents was retested to estimate reliability statistics. Results A model with a single threshold was the best fit, with the estimated threshold of 565 000 (95% CI: 9500-11 600 000) prescriptions dispensed per year. Above the threshold, there was a significant association between dispensing and estimates (p < 0.001); below the threshold, the relationship was not significant (p = 0.912). Above the threshold, responses were more reliable than random chance, and reliability steadily increased with increased dispensing. Conclusions These results suggest the threshold demarcates two distinct pharmacoepidemiological paradigms when investigating drug use in general population surveys.

To test our hypotheses, we surveyed 238 employees with online questionnaires twice on one workday. In general, results showed that job stressors were negatively associated with self-regulatory resources that, in turn, were associated with accommodation. In particular, situational constraints, but not workload, negatively related to self-regulatory resources. Self-regulatory resources were negatively associated with destructive reactions, but unrelated to constructive reactions.

When the goal of machine assistance is to improve the accuracy of human decisions, it might seem appealing to design ML algorithms that complement human knowledge.

In this study, we demonstrate that in practice decision aids that are not complementary, but make errors similar to human ones may have their own benefits. In a series of human-subject experiments with a total of 901 participants, we study how the similarity of human and machine errors influences human perceptions of and interactions with algorithmic decision aids. We find that (i) people perceive more similar decision aids as more useful, accurate, and predictable, and that (ii) people are more likely to take opposing advice from more similar decision aids, while (iii) decision aids that are less similar to humans have more opportunities to provide opposing advice, resulting in a higher influence on people's decisions overall.",9/8/22,10/6/22 18:00,10/22/22 19:03,10/6/22 18:00,,,,,,,Taking Advice from (Dis)Similar Machines,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv:2209.03821 [cs],,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/YJK62FKT/2209.html; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/CBUU95IM/Grgić-Hlača et al_2022_Taking Advice from (Dis)Similar Machines.pdf,,,Computer Science - Computers and Society; Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In parallel-designed experiments, 975 participants from the general adult population participated in 1 of 5 experiments following a 2(format: “1-in-X” or “N-in-X*N”) × 4(scenarios) mixed design. Participants assessed the risk of contracting a disease on either a verbal probability scale (Experiment 1) or a numerical probability/frequency scale with immediate (Experiments 2–3) or delayed presentation (Experiments 4–5).

Critically, the “1-in-X” ratios led to a larger objective overestimation of numerical probabilities than did the “N-in-X*N” ratios. People with lower levels of health literacy and numeracy were not more sensitive to the bias.

Ecological momentary interventions (EMIs), which use mobile phones to deliver near-real-time psychosocial interventions in daily life, offer the possibility of increasing intervention efficacy. This randomized controlled trial examined the feasibility and efficacy of an EMI for reducing psychological distress among students with and without an emotional abuse history. Undergraduate students (N = 382) were randomly assigned to receive (a) an EMI that taught stress management skills, or (b) an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with self-monitoring of stressors and mood. Both the EMI and EMA lasted for 14 days. Participants completed outcome measures (e.g., depression, anxiety, stress symptoms) at pretest, posttest, and 3-week follow-up. Overall, the EMI appeared feasible, acceptable, and usable, with 80% to 91% completion rates. Linear mixed models indicated that there were no significant Condition × Time interaction effects in the total sample, with decreases in perceived stress and increases in positive affect over time regardless of condition (EMI vs. EMA). Moderation analyses indicated that the EMI was generally more effective for those with a history of emotional abuse and that the EMA was more effective for those without such a history. Post hoc analyses demonstrated that participants wrote less in the EMI than in a web-based version of the intervention. Future interventions could target at-risk groups based on trauma history or baseline distress.

Drawing from the master narrative framework, this mixed-methods study aimed to describe Asian Americans’ experiences in Asian/White interracial relationships, identify master and alternative narratives of addressing racial differences within participants’ responses, and examine how narratives relate to psychological adjustment and relationship quality. Participants (N = 189) were self-identified Asian American young adults in committed relationships with White romantic partners. Using thematic analysis, I found that participants received three forms of cultural socialization about Asian/White relationships: Promoting Ethnic-Racial Pride, White Supremacy and Racism, and Racial De-Emphasis. Cultural socialization also informed four racial tropes about Asian/White relationships: Fetishization of Multiracial Children, Ethnic-Racial Betrayal, Asian Female/White Male Couples, and Asian Male/White Female Couples. Using thematic analysis, I also identified societal narratives of Color-Blindness, Multiculturalism, and Racial Awareness that were internalized in participants’ discussions of race and racial differences in their relationships. Quantitative coding of narrative internalization found that Multiculturalism had the highest mean rating, followed by Color-Blindness and then Racial Awareness. Multiple linear regressions were conducted to determine the main effects of narrative internalization on relationship quality, psychological distress, social belonging, and ethnic-racial identity affect. None of the main effects were significant except for the Multiculturalism narrative on ethnic-racial identity affect (B = .10, SE = .05, p = .04); however, this effect was no longer significant when analyses were repeated with a subsample (n = 186) that excluded inattentive responders (n = 3).

Considering that many advertisements claim that e-cigs are superior to cigarettes, individuals' likelihood to view e-cigs more favorably than cigarettes can also influence subsequent e-cig use; however, no studies have directly assessed such a comparison. Objectives: The present study created and validated the Comparing E-Cigarettes and Cigarettes questionnaire (CEAC), which asks individuals to directly compare e-cigs and cigarettes on a number of dimensions, in two independent samples. Methods: In sample 1 (451 undergraduates; mean age = 20.35, SD = 5.44, 72.4% female, 73.4% Caucasian) we explored the factor structure of the CEAC and in sample 2 (699 community adults collected via Amazon's Mechanical Turk; mean age = 34.04, SD = 10.9, 47.7% female, 83.3% Caucasian) we replicated the factor structure. Results: Exploratory factor analysis suggested a three-factor structure: General Benefits (α = 0.80), General Effects (α = 0.86), and Health Benefits (α = 0.88), which was replicated via confirmatory factor analysis, χ2 = 4.36; RMSEA = 0.07, 90% CI = 0.06–0.08; TLI = 0.99; CFI = 0.99, and was relatively invariant across product use and gender. Individuals reported viewing e-cigs as safer and more beneficial than cigarettes and these beliefs were higher in e-cig users. Conclusions: Future work should establish how these comparative beliefs are influenced by e-cig use and/or influence subsequent transition to and increases in e-cig use.

In this study, we investigated the latent structure of Criterion A (a) within subdomains, (b) across subdomains, and (c) in conjunction with the Criterion B trait facets. Data were gathered as part of an online study that collected other-ratings by 515 laypersons and 145 therapists. Laypersons were asked to assess 1 of their personal acquaintances, whereas therapists were asked to assess 1 of their patients, using 135 items that captured features of Criteria A and B. We were able to show that (a) the structure within the Criterion A subdomains can be appropriately modeled using generalized graded unfolding models, with results suggesting that the items are indeed related to common underlying constructs but often deviate from their theoretically expected severity level; (b) the structure across subdomains is broadly in line with a model comprising 2 strongly correlated factors of self- and interpersonal functioning, with some notable deviations from the theoretical model; and (c) the joint structure of the Criterion A subdomains and the Criterion B facets broadly resembles the expected model of 2 plus 5 factors, albeit the loading pattern suggests that the distinction between Criteria A and B is somewhat blurry.

VIA posits 24 character strengths that are purportedly valued across cultures and promote the well-being of both individuals and communities. However, unresolved limitations in the assessment of these character strengths continue to hamper theoretical progress in research on human character based on the VIA framework. Here we sought to lay a new foundation for ad-vanced assessment of strengths by refining and extensively validating an existing open-science inventory from the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP). Using data from a U.S. community sample and four quota samples from the United Kingdom and Germany, we investigated whether valid, cross-culturally comparable, and economical assessment of the VIA character strengths is possible with the IPIP. Experts selected suitable items with the aim to obtain 24 balanced-keyed short scales. Different experts then translated these items to German. Through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, we established essential unidimensionality and well-fitting measure-ment models for each scale. All scales achieved at least partial scalar invariance across languages. Reliability estimates were satisfactory. Extensive analyses of the strengths’ nomological network placed character strengths between Big Five personality traits and basic human values, confirming that VIA strengths emphasize self-transcendence rather than self-enhancement. With few excep-tions, the 24 character strengths scales were sufficiently distinct from the Big Five, and many showed incremental predictive validity, also for “good life” criteria.

We contend that a member’s trust in his or her deviant team depends on the member’s own deviant actions; although all members will judge the actions of their deviant teams as rational evidence that they should not be trusted, deviant members, but not honest members, can hold on to trust in their teams because of a sense of connection to the team. We tested our predictions in a field study of 562 members across 111 teams and 24 organizations as well as in an experiment of 178 participants in deviant and non-deviant teams. Both studies show that honest members experience a greater decline in trust as team deviance goes up. Moreover, our experiment finds that deviant members have as much trust in their deviant teams as honest members do in honest teams, but only in teams with coordinated rather than independent acts of deviance, in which deviant members engage in a variety of ongoing dynamics foundational to a sense of connection and affective-based trust.

We argue that implications of work-to-nonwork integration may be better understood by learning more about the reasons why employees perform integration behavior. Based on the reasoned action approach (RAA), we examined four antecedents of employee integration behavior: individuals’ attitudes toward integration (integration preference), perceived employer expectations (injunctive norms), perceived integration behavior of coworkers (descriptive norms), and perceived control to manage the work–nonwork interface (behavioral control). The results of structural equation modeling with a heterogeneous sample of 748 employees indicated the relevance of all four RAA factors in explaining integration behavior 1 month later. Specifically, the individual preference to integrate evolved as the strongest motivational aspect, followed by injunctive norms. Additionally, our results suggest that injunctive and descriptive norms each explained unique variance in integration behavior. Organizational interventions may aim at shaping both norms and behavioral control to improve employees’ work–nonwork boundary management. Furthermore, making employees aware of the importance of their integration preferences is a critical factor for actively managing the work–nonwork interface.",10/1/20,10/6/22 18:01,10/6/22 18:01,10/6/22 18:01,683-696,,5,35,,J Bus Psychol,Understanding Employee Motivation for Work-to-Nonwork Integration Behavior,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/UZLG6AM3/Palm et al_2020_Understanding Employee Motivation for Work-to-Nonwork Integration Behavior.pdf,,,Boundary management; Boundary theory; Reasoned action approach; Work–nonwork interface,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The development of the scale comprised literature research, held 14 focus groups and 12 interviews with patients and health care providers, item-pool generation, content validation by a scientific expert panel, and face validation by 90 patients. The preliminary scale was tested on 385 patients across seven German hospitals with cross-sectoral mental health care (CSMHC) as part of their treatment program. Psychometric properties of the scale were evaluated using genuine and transformed data scoring. To check reliability and postdictive validity of the scale, Cronbach’s α coefficient and multivariable linear regression were used. This development process led to the development of an 18-item scale called the “Scale for Evaluation of Psychiatric Integrative and Continuous Care (SEPICC)” with a two-point and five-point response options. The scale consists of two sections. The first section assesses the presence or absence of patients’ experiences with various CSMHC’ relevant components such as home treatment, flexibility of treatments’ switching, case management, continuity of care, cross-sectoral therapeutic groups, and multidisciplinary teams. The second section evaluates the patients’ opinions about these relevant components. Using raw and transformed scoring resulted into comparable results. However, data distribution using transformed scoring showed a smaller deviation from normality. For the overall scale, the Cronbach’s α coefficient was 0.82.

In conclusion, the new scale provides a good starting point for further validation. It can be used as a tool to evaluate CSMHC.

The preconditions for an effective game-based learning process include the presence of high learning interest and the desire to study hard. Therefore, educational video game design has to tailor gameplay to the style of the playing learner, i.e. to the psycho-cognitive abilities, attitudes, and skills of the individual player, in order to foster the player's motivation and creativity. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to draw a parallel between learning styles and styles of playing video games, and to investigate the correlations between these types of constructs. The article presents a new family of playing styles based on Kolb's experiential learning theory that is appropriate to be used for educational video games. This family is composed of four playing styles: Competitor, Dreamer, Logician, and Strategist, and corresponds to Honey and Mumford's learning styles based also on the theory of experiential learning, namely Activist, Reflector, Theorist, and Pragmatist. To measure the four playing styles, a 40-item questionnaire was designed. In order to verify the consistency, validity, and reliability of that questionnaire as an accurate tool for recognizing the four suggested player styles, a pilot study was conducted. The article reports the results obtained from the study, along with their analysis and applicability.",8/1/18,10/6/22 18:02,10/6/22 18:02,10/6/22 18:02,319-328,,,85,,Computers in Human Behavior,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/4IFA4EZD/Bontchev et al_2018_Playing styles based on experiential learning theory.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/REE62KZD/S0747563218301717.html,,,Experiential learning; Playing style; Questionnaire; Video games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Innovative technologies are increasingly finding their way into training, creating new ways to deliver content. This raises questions about whether training presentation modes that vary in technological sophistication affect beliefs individuals form before training even begins. One such belief is training self-efficacy, which is known to influence learning outcomes. This experiment asked participants (N = 229) to review a cross-cultural training program flyer. Participants were randomly assigned to view one of four flyers, which described the training presentation mode as either using comic strips, videos, virtual reality, or did not mention a presentation mode for those in the control condition. Participants were asked to imagine what it would be like to participate in the training. They then completed a training self-efficacy scale measuring confidence in their ability to succeed in the program described on the flyer they reviewed. They also rated their technology self-efficacy. Results revealed technology self-efficacy partially moderated the effects of presentation mode on training self-efficacy.

We contend that entrepreneurial apologies are an effective mechanism for entrepreneurs to receive forgiveness and that forgiveness mediates the relationship between the apology and the restoration of future cooperation by reducing the amount of retributive justice sought by stakeholders. Quantitative analysis of data from a questionnaire administered to 268 U.S. university students and 120 U.S. participants on Mechanical Turk supports our contention, with participants found to be significantly more forgiving of an entrepreneurial transgression after receiving an apology and also more willing to engage in future cooperation with the new venture if forgiveness was restored. We also demonstrate the mediating effects of forgiveness on an apology, suggesting that restorative and retributive justice elements inherent in an apology interact to increase the overall effectiveness. Finally, it was also uncovered that compensation offers were significantly more restorative than non-explicit statements of contrition, explicit statements of contrition, empathy, and responsibility acknowledgements.",6/1/20,10/6/22 18:02,10/6/22 18:02,10/6/22 18:02,e00147,,,13,,Journal of Business Venturing Insights,Entrepreneurial apologies,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/IGI6FVNR/Clarke_Rhodes_2020_Entrepreneurial apologies.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/VNZXQXKT/S2352673419300691.html,,,Cooperation; Apology; Forgiveness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Participants recruited online using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk read and rated haiku and sonnets on four characteristics: valence, arousal, vividness, and aesthetic appeal. Our results indicate that individuals vary greatly in experiencing aesthetic pleasure, with high disagreement about which poems they found most appealing. However, across participants, vividness of imagery was the strongest contributor to aesthetic pleasure, followed by valence and arousal. While individual poems vary greatly in their appeal to individual readers, individuals generally agree about the perceived emotional valence of poems in both genres.

We tested our hypotheses in three independent studies with employees. We first established the effect of proactive work behavior on work meaningfulness in a scenario-based experiment (n = 140). A second experiment (n = 116) replicated this and also demonstrated that the effect was not driven by the benefits of proactive work behavior to others. A daily diary study (n = 107, k = 391) showed that day-level proactive work behavior was positively associated with daily work meaningfulness and that this effect was again independent from having benefitted others. The results also confirmed that this relationship was stronger when an individual's job was characterized by unpredictability of the future.

Therefore, the main purpose of the study was to enhance our understanding of the role of cognitive load in deceptive IM within job interviews. More specifically, the study explored how cognitive load manipulations influence the mental capacities of honest applicants and those using deceptive IM, and how they react to these manipulations. The study also explored the effects of these manipulations on the detection rates of deceptive IM. University student participants (N = 238) were randomly assigned to mock interviews that either imposed or did not impose cognitive load, and they were also instructed to be either honest or use deceptive IM. The results of the thesis found that cognitive load manipulations were effective in increasing perceived cognitive load. Furthermore, there were mixed results on the effect of cognitive load manipulations on applicant reactions and interview performance. The cognitive load manipulations were also not effective in increasing the detection rates of deceptive IM to chance levels.

Two informal workplace dynamics that are particularly important for how employees think about information security comprise senior management support and workplace norms. However, there are limitations to empirical research to date on these constructs, including conflicting evidence on the relationship between senior management support and information security attitudes and a lack of research on how norms impact self-efficacy beliefs. Also, although some studies suggest that norms might play a mediating role between information security attitudes, self-efficacy beliefs and their (informal and formal) antecedents, empirical research is yet to investigate these possibilities. Consequently, this study considers the relationships between senior management support, norms, formal controls and information security attitudes and self-efficacy beliefs. It comprises a cross-sectional survey of employees at a law enforcement organisation.

Underlying this perspective is the assumption that all leader behaviors that encourage “normatively appropriate conduct” will influence followers in a similar fashion. Put differently, the current consensus seems to suggest that actions that focus on preventing unethical behavior—attending to “the wrong”—will have the same impact as actions that focus on promoting ethical behavior—attending to “the right.” Taking a within-person approach, we draw upon social exchange theory to challenge this consensus and build theory that suggests a follower's felt trust from their leader will be differentially impacted by prevention- versus promotion-focused ethical leadership. We also explore how these different types of ethical leadership may indirectly, through felt trust, impact citizenship behavior and counterproductive work behavior. Finally, we consider how the role of the “moral manager” may interact with the “moral person” by identifying leader moral hypocrisy as an important between-person moderator of these effects.

In Canada, provinces and territories are moving towards implementing HPV testing in cervical cancer screening programs. While an abundance of research exists on the benefits of HPV-based screening, there is a dearth of research examining women’s understanding of HPV testing. In other countries, failure to adequately address women’s concerns about changes has disrupted implementation of HPV-based screening. This study protocol describes a multi-step approach to develop psychometrically valid measures and to investigate psychosocial correlates of women’s intentions to participate in HPV-based cervical cancer screening. Materials and Methods We conducted a web-based survey of Canadian women to assess the acceptability and feasibility of a questionnaire, including validation of scales examining: cervical cancer knowledge, HPV testing knowledge, HPV testing attitudes and beliefs, and HPV test self-sampling attitudes and beliefs. Preferences for cervical cancer screening were assessed using Best-Worst Scaling methodology.A second web-based survey will be administered to a national sample of Canadian women in June-July of 2022 using the validated scales. Differences in the knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and preferences of women who are currently either underscreened or adequately screened for cervical cancer will be examined through bivariate analyses. Multinomial logistic regression will be used to estimate the associations between psychosocial and sociodemographic factors and intentions to screen using HPV-based screening. Study Impact and Dissemination Findings will provide direction for Canadian public health authorities to align guidelines to address women’s concerns and optimize acceptability and uptake of HPV-based primary screening. Validated scales can be used by other researchers to improve and standardize measurement of psychosocial factors impacting HPV test acceptability. Study results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal articles, conference presentations, and direct communication with researchers, clinicians, policymakers, media, and specialty organizations.",4/5/22,10/6/22 18:09,10/22/22 19:02,10/6/22 18:09,,,,,,,Ensuring a successful transition from Pap to HPV-based primary screening in Canada,,,,,,,en,"© 2022, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

This study assessed the (discriminant) content validity of the most widely used alexithymia scale, i.e., the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). Methods Participants (n = 81) rated to what extent TAS-20 items and items of related constructs were relevant for assessing the constructs ‘alexithymia’, ‘difficulty identifying feelings’, ‘difficulty describing feelings’, ‘externally-oriented thinking’, ‘limited imaginal capacity’, ‘anxiety’, ‘depression’, and ‘health anxiety’. Results Results revealed that, overall, the TAS-20 did only partly measure ‘alexithymia’. Only the subscales ‘difficulty identifying feelings’ and ‘difficulty describing feelings’ represented ‘alexithymia’ and their intended construct, although some content overlap between these subscales was found.

However, there are few assessment tools to evaluate how these students approach information. Purpose The authors integrated information literacy standards with self-directed learning theory to create the self-directed information literacy (SIL) scale as an assessment of students' self-directedness using high-quality information skills in engineering projects. The purpose of this research is to examine the measurement properties of SIL to inform the use and interpretation of SIL's scores among diverse learners. Method The authors administered SIL to first-year engineering and technology students (n = 1,603). To test three hypotheses about SIL scores related to validity, reliability, and fairness, we conducted a series of psychometric analyses, including confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and measurement invariance between groups. Results The results of the CFA were acceptable for the proposed higher-order factor structure of SIL and a separate Beginner Behavior factor. Measurement models for male and female scores were found invariant; however, there were measurement differences between groups of students based on their experience with instruction in the English language. Conclusions SIL can be scored to assess engineering and technology students' specific SIL subfactors (Recognize, Seek, Evaluate, Apply, Document, and Reflect) or scored as an overall broader measure of self-directedness with information. A separate factor, Beginner Behavior, can be used to moderate ceiling effects.

We use the dual pathway to creativity model to examine whether the act of forgiving increases creativity via cognitive persistence (generating detailed ideas within a small number of categories), but not via cognitive flexibility (generating multiple categories and switching ideas between categories). Two experiments conducted within separate Korean and US samples provided convergent evidence that cognitive persistence, not flexibility, mediates the forgiving-creativity link. Our study suggests that how cognitive resources are deployed serves as a driving mechanism for the creativity-related benefits of forgiving.

Despite consumers' increased interest in adopting a healthy lifestyle, the pursuit of wellness could make consumers feel stressed, which can cause or lead to many diseases. To reduce their stress, consumers can use either a problem-focused or emotion-focused coping strategy. A problem-focused coping strategy focuses on potential actions one can take in response to stress. In contrast, an emotion-focused coping strategy focuses on the emotional consequences of the situation and regulating the resulting emotions. Based on implicit self-theories, this research suggests that consumers' different mindsets, either a growth or fixed mindset, influence their preferences for coping strategies to mitigate stress. The results of this study indicated that consumers with a growth mindset (vs. a fixed mindset) prefer to use a problem-focused coping strategy (vs. emotion-focused coping strategy) to reduce health-related stress. Process evidence suggests that the findings are driven by differences in consumers' mindsets and how much they attribute their stress to controllable factors. Practical implications are discussed and include approaches medical professionals can use to implement a tailored messaging strategy based on the patient's mindset.",2022,10/6/22 18:09,10/6/22 18:09,10/6/22 18:09,773-785,,4,21,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cb.2036,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/I35DVJT5/Hong et al_2022_The role of consumer mindsets to reduce health-related stress.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/RWTJKEZ3/cb.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, occupant preferences were evaluated, in particular which rooms are prioritized in terms of daylight availability. The study deployed a questionnaire survey that was carried out in typical multi-dwelling apartment blocks in Malmö, Sweden (Latitude: 55.6 °N). Occupants were asked to report how often they use electric lighting during daylight hours (EL) in their kitchen, living room and main bedroom, and how much of the floor area they perceive as adequately daylit (DA) throughout the year. Responses EL and DA were measured in seven-point semantic differential scales, and were correlated (Spearman) to evaluate their association for different room groups. Groups were based on age, room function, façade orientation, balcony obstruction and fenestration geometry. In addition, occupants were asked which room they would choose if there had to be one underlit room. Results indicate that EL is strongly associated with DA in the overall room sample (rS = −0.588, p < .01, n = 225). The association is persistent across room groups of different characteristics, with the Spearman rank correlation coefficient ranging between −0.4 and −0.8, and not differing significantly between groups.

The purpose of this paper is to provide researchers, who are new to multicountry investigations, a discussion of the issues that one needs to address in order to be properly prepared to begin the cross-cultural analyses of relationships. Design/methodology/approach Thus, the authors consider two uniquely different but integrally connected challenges to getting ready to conduct the relevant analyses for just such multicountry studies. The first challenge is to collect the data. The second challenge is to prepare (clean) the collected data for analysis. Accordingly, the authors divide this paper into two parts to discuss the steps involved in both for multicountry studies. Findings The authors highlight the fact that in the process of collecting, there are a number of key issues that should be kept in mind including building trust with new team members, leading the team, and determining sufficient contribution of team members for authorship. Subsequently, the authors draw the reader’s attention to the equally important, but often-overlooked, data cleaning process and the steps that constitute it. This is important because failing to take serious the quality of the data can lead to violations of assumptions and mis-estimations of parameters and effects.

The sample comprise of 21 male and 26 female students. The questionnaire consists of three parameters, namely students' knowledge, skills, and attitude towards industrial training. These parameters were identified as three domains of educational activities based on Bloom's Taxanomy. Students were required to answer 23 questions to assess their perception before and after undergoing industrial training. The Likert scale used in the questionnaire comprises of a one to five level of satisfaction scale (1 = not at all satisfied to 5 = extremely satisfied).The Winstep and Microsoft Excel software was used to analyse the survey. Winstep was used to evaluate the validity and reliability of the questions, while Microsoft Excel was used to assess the effectiveness of the industrial training from students' perspective, namely whether their perception has improved, remain unchanged, or decreased.

The tune-out effect fully replicated in those experimental conditions that represented close replications of the original study, underscoring the reliability of the original effect. However, the effect disappeared when the same monetary incentives for participation were expressed in terms of a loss (i.e., losing money for each wrong answer) rather than a gain (i.e., earning money for each correct answer; Experiment 1). The effect also disappeared when additional corrective feedback was given (Experiment 2). It seems that switching from gain to loss framing or giving corrective feedback (vs. no corrective feedback) are substantial and meaningful variations of the original paradigm that constitute boundary conditions of the tune-out effect. These results help explain the conflicting findings on learning from failure and suggest that in many applied settings, tuning out upon failure might not be an option.

We conducted an online experiment where 199 participants used different explanation interfaces to understand an algorithm for making university admissions decisions.

In addition, like most performance measurement in the field, existing instruments measure the occurrence of job crafting behaviors without explicitly measuring the intentions behind the behaviors. There is the possibility that an individual could engage in seemingly prosocial behavior, but be doing it for their gain. Doing good for malicious purposes is qualitatively different than doing good for its own sake, and this is not currently measured. Study 1 developed a new measure of job crafting, looking at both ""dark"" and ""bright,"" prevention-oriented and promotion-oriented, and task and relationship job crafting using the frame-of-reference effect, allowing for improved understanding of the intentionality behind job crafting behaviors (Lievens, Corte, & Schollaert, 2008). Two independent samples showed support for the hypothesized forms of job crafting strategies (Study 1: n = 452 employees from Amazon's Mechanical Turk: Study 2: n = 376 employees from Amazon's Mechanical Turk). Also, Study 2 links the newly constructed job crafting measure with commonly examined predictors and outcomes, including individual needs, the Dark Triad, conscientiousness, counterproductive work behaviors (CWBs), and organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs). Results reveal that items with the same stems and different appendages tapping into intentionality operate differently in terms of their relationships with predictors and performance variables. The findings suggest that that the intentionality behind job crafting behaviors is predicted differentially by individual needs (relatedness and competence; Deci & Ryan, 2000) as well as personality traits (the Dark Triad and conscientiousness). Bright job crafting is more associated with engagement in OCBs while dark job crafting is more associated with engagement in CWBs. Interestingly, OCBs and CWBs are significantly related, as are dark job crafting and bright job crafting, further supporting prior research that behavior in individuals is not limited to a continuum of ""dark"" or ""bright,"" and behavior that harms and helps the organization can be enacted by the same individual simultaneously (Dalal, 2005; Spector, Bauer, & Fox, 2010).

This means it is important that a child’s testimony of the event is detailed, specific, and accurate (Salmon et al., 2012). To help elicit these testimonies, interviewers may ask children to “draw what happened to them”. These drawings then become an evidential exhibit presented to jury members in court (Cohen-Liebman, 2013). The presentation of drawings alongside a child’s testimony may impact how competent and trustworthy a child witness is perceived to be (Danby et al., 2021). Across two studies, the current research explored the beliefs that jury members hold about children’s drawings and the impact that these beliefs may have on the evaluation of a child’s testimony. Within the first study, potential jurors (N=503) completed an online survey exploring their beliefs about the use of drawings within forensic settings. Drawings were generally thought to be highly beneficial and allow access into a child’s cognitive world; however, participants also identified some risks associated with having children draw. The second study investigated whether the presence of a child’s drawing alongside their testimony influenced how the child witness was perceived. Within this study, potential jurors (N=502) read a simulated transcript of a child reporting a traffic incident and rated the child witness’ credibility. Within each transcript, the child’s age (6 or 10years-old) and the drawing they presented (no drawing, low-quality drawing, or high-quality drawing) were manipulated. All findings indicated that the child’s age and the presence of a drawing had no significant influence on child credibility ratings. Collectively, these studies suggest that although jurors hold strong beliefs about the meaning within children’s drawings, these beliefs may not always influence jurors’ evaluation of a child witness. However, further research is required to comprehensively understand the conditions in which drawings may be a highly compelling and influential form of evidence.",8/9/22,10/6/22 18:22,10/22/22 20:24,10/6/22 18:22,,,,,,,Crayons in the Courtroom,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,DOI: 10.26686/wgtn.20452878,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/T4RKMMJQ/Curtis - 2022 - Crayons in the Courtroom Jurors’ Beliefs about Ch.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These behaviors are often identified as discretionary, and are generally less likely to be measured in terms of performance or rewarded in terms of promotions or monetary rewards. The most commonly studied form of OCB is helping behavior. Past research has examined individual characteristics and organizational variables predicting who is likely to perform helping behaviors; however, little research has examined variables predicting the reciprocation of helping behaviors in an organizational context, especially between two individual parties. This study is based on the idea that the decision to reciprocate helping behaviors is one that will vary based on social exchange theory. Furthermore, it specifically examines the characteristics of certain episodes and the actors involved that may substitute or enhance the effects of being in a social exchange relationship. Specifically, the present study explored the following moderators of the effects of social exchange on employees' decisions to reciprocate helping: (1) individual characteristics of the potential reciprocator (including conscientiousness, capability, and the belief in the norm of reciprocity), (2) individual characteristics of the target of reciprocation (including general helpfulness, likeability, and capability), (3) characteristics of the relationship between parties involved (the quality of the social exchange relationship and balance of the exchange relationship at the time of helping), and (4) characteristics of the help received (including the degree to which the help was helpful and the degree to which the help was difficult to perform). The sample for this study consisted of 346 employees recruited through the Amazon Mechanical Turk service (MTurk) and 217 student employees. Participants responded to a survey with measures of all of the variables of interest. Correlations, hierarchical multiple regression, and moderated multiple regression analyses were performed to test the hypotheses. The results showed strong support for a positive relationship between the quality of one's social exchange relationship with a coworker and the likeliness to reciprocate helping to that coworker. However, there was no evidence that the balance of one's social exchange relationship was related to helping reciprocation. Additionally, there was no evidence of moderation effects for the characteristics of the potential reciprocator, the target for reciprocation, or the help itself. Instead, some of the variables investigated functioned as direct predictors for helping reciprocation, beyond the effects of the quality of social exchange relationship, while some had no relationship to helping reciprocation at all. The strongest effects were found for conscientiousness of the potential reciprocator and the degree to which the potential reciprocator perceived the help he/she received as helpful. The characteristics of the target of reciprocation were not as important in one's decision to reciprocate helping. Although the moderation hypotheses were not supported, the findings for the direct effects on helping reciprocation contribute to the OCB and social exchange research in the context of employee-employee relationships. Practical implications and directions for future research are discussed.",,10/6/22 18:25,10/22/22 20:32,10/6/22 18:25,,,,,,,The decision to reciprocate OCB,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9781303497179,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/L5HE464G/Boulanger_The decision to reciprocate OCB.pdf,,,Social sciences; Psychology; Organizational Citizenship Behaviors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Information privacy perceptions refer to perceptions of control over the acquisition, storage, use, and dissemination of one’s information. Research demonstrates that information privacy perceptions influence work relevant attitudes and behaviors as people work, but research has yet to explore how these perceptions affect people during workday breaks. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of breaktime information privacy on breaktime experiences and recovery. Study 1 and Study 2 detail the development and validation of a short scale to measure breaktime information privacy. In Study 3, the nomological network of breaktime information privacy was explored and construct validity evidence was collected. Finally, in Study 4, experience-sampling methodology was used to test hypotheses at the within-person level in sample of working adults who reported on their lunch break experiences during 6 consecutive workdays. Results suggest that breaktime information privacy perceptions vary within-person from day-to-day and are positively related breaktime control and negatively related to privacy invasion. Moreover, breaktime information privacy was found to indirectly relate to post-break recovery through its relationship with breaktime control.

In the USA, where over 14% of the population is comprised of foreign-born individuals, immigrants continue to face prejudice from both the public and political administration. Intergroup Threat Theory (ITT) explains this prejudice as stemming from the perception that the out-group poses a threat to the cultural purity, economic stability, or physical safety of the in-group. Traits that promote group exclusion, such as perceived group superiority (i.e. Right-Wing Authoritarianism; RWA, Social Dominance Orientation; SDO, cultural dominance; CD) and strict, essentialist group boundaries (i.e. Nationalism), were explored alongside worldviews that promote inclusion, such as multicultural ideology (MCI), cultural openness (CO), general empathy, and multicultural empathy in the context of perceived threat and as they predicted anti-immigrant prejudice. Exclusionary Beliefs (i.e. RWA, SDO, CD, NATL) and Inclusionary Beliefs (i.e. MCI, CO, empathy, multicultural empathy) were independently related to perceived threat and anti-immigrant prejudice. Exclusionary Beliefs were predictive of greater anti-immigrant prejudice through the lens of perceived threat; participants who endorsed greater Exclusionary Beliefs were more likely to endorse anti-immigrant sentiment, which partially stemmed from perceived threat. Inclusionary Beliefs were predictive of greater anti-immigrant prejudice through the lens of perceived threat; participants who endorsed greater Inclusionary Beliefs were less likely to endorse anti-immigrant sentiment, which partially stemmed from lower levels of perceived threat. Despite the significant relations between exclusionary traits and prejudices and inclusionary traits and prejudice, the overall model failed to reach significance, suggesting that additional research is needed to understand the relation between Exclusionary Beliefs, Inclusionary Beliefs, perceived threat, and anti-immigrant prejudice.",2020,10/6/22 18:25,10/22/22 20:00,10/6/22 18:25,,,,,,,"Exclusionary Beliefs, Multicultural Ideology, Empathy, and Perceived Threat",,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798664790160 Publication Title: ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,,"/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/5UISSEFS/El-Yashruti_2020_Exclusionary Beliefs, Multicultural Ideology, Empathy, and Perceived Threat.pdf",,,Empathy; Prejudice; Perceived threat; Cultural dominance; Cultural openness; Immigrant; Multicultural empathy; Multicultural ideology; Nationalism; RWA; SDO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Time management skills, such as those required to plan, prioritize, and execute tasks are crucial to cultivating stable routines. Although measures of routines exist for children, adolescents, families, and older adults, the routines of younger adults have been neglected.

Thus, it is critical to study the postadoption behaviors of current users to enhance their engagement with personal health devices and use behaviors. However, there is little empirical research on the factors affecting users’ engagement in beneficial use behaviors. Mindfulness and identity are not new topics, but the applications of these concepts in the field of information systems are emerging themes. Information technology (IT) mindfulness has been conceptualized in previous studies; however, little is known about the antecedents and consequences of IT mindfulness in the mobile health (mHealth) context. Objective: The main aim of this study is to explore both IT identity and IT mindfulness to develop a new ground for research in the domain of mHealth postadoption. Thus, we aim to explain why users should be fully mindful of their engagement with PHDs and what could be the consequences and implications. Methods: This study proposes that IT mindfulness can play an important role in improving the use behaviors of users. Through a web-based survey with 450 current users of a personal health device, this paper tests the relationship between IT identity and IT mindfulness in the postadoption stage of using personal health devices. Results: We found that IT identity significantly shapes IT mindfulness associated with PHDs. Moreover, the IT identity–IT mindfulness relationship is negatively moderated by individuals’ perceived health status (P=.003). Finally, the results of this study show that IT mindfulness can significantly predict automatic use behaviors (eg, continued intention to use), active use behaviors (eg, feature use and enhanced use behaviors), and commitment behaviors in using personal health devices (eg, positive word-of-mouth intention). Conclusions: The findings of this study provide implications for both research and practice. This study can contribute to our current understanding of IT mindfulness by developing and empirically testing a research model that explains the determinants and outcomes of the IT mindfulness construct in the context of personal health devices. The results imply that IT mindfulness significantly helps individuals express their alertness, awareness, openness, and orientation in the present in their postadoption interactions with smart devices used for health care purposes. Finally, our findings may assist practitioners and IT developers in designing mindfulness-supporting PHDs. Owing to the impact of IT mindfulness on postadoption behaviors, its 4 dimensions could be used for developing PHD technologies. Moreover, PHD developers may need to direct their efforts toward increasing IT mindfulness by reinforcing IT identity to serve and retain a wide range of target users.",10/5/20,10/6/22 18:25,10/6/22 18:25,10/6/22 18:25,e18122,,10,8,,,The Role of Information Technology Mindfulness in the Postadoption Stage of Using Personal Health Devices,,,,,,,EN,"Unless stated otherwise, all articles are open-access distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work (""first published in JMIR mHealth and uHealth..."") is properly cited with original URL and bibliographic citation information.

These providers could serve in a network (affiliated) or practice separately (unaffiliated). Thus, using secure and reliable health information exchange (HIE) mechanisms would be critical to transfer sensitive personal health information (PHI) across distances. Studying patients' perceptions and opinions about exchange mechanisms could help health care providers build more complete HIEs' databases and develop robust privacy policies, consent processes, and patient education programs.   Objectives Due to the exploratory nature of this study, we aim to shed more light on public perspectives (benefits, concerns, and risks) associated with the four data exchange practices in the health care sector.   Methods In this study, we compared public perceptions and expectations regarding four common types of exchange mechanisms used in the United States (i.e., traditional, direct, query-based, patient-mediated exchange mechanisms). Traditional is an exchange through fax, paper mailing, or phone calls, direct is a provider-to-provider exchange, query-based is sharing patient data with a central repository, and patient-mediated is an exchange mechanism in which patients can access data and monitor sharing. Data were collected from 1,624 subjects using an online survey to examine the benefits, risks, and concerns associated with the four exchange mechanisms from patients' perspectives.   Results Findings indicate that several concerns and risks such as privacy concerns, security risks, trust issues, and psychological risks are raised. Besides, multiple benefits such as access to complete information, communication improvement, timely and convenient information sharing, cost-saving, and medical error reduction are highlighted by respondents. Through consideration of all risks and benefits associated with the four exchange mechanisms, the direct HIE mechanism was selected by respondents as the most preferred mechanism of information exchange among providers. More than half of the respondents (56.18%) stated that overall they favored direct exchange over the other mechanisms. 42.70% of respondents expected to be more likely to share their PHI with health care providers who implemented and utilized a direct exchange mechanism. 43.26% of respondents believed that they would support health care providers to leverage a direct HIE mechanism for sharing their PHI with other providers. The results exhibit that individuals expect greater benefits and fewer adverse effects from direct HIE among health care providers. Overall, the general public sentiment is more in favor of direct data transfer. Our results highlight that greater public trust in exchange mechanisms is required, and information privacy and security risks must be addressed before the widespread implementation of such mechanisms.   Conclusion This exploratory study's findings could be interesting for health care providers and HIE policymakers to analyze how consumers perceive the current exchange mechanisms, what concerns should be addressed, and how the exchange mechanisms could be modified to meet consumers' needs.",2020-08,10/6/22 18:25,10/6/22 18:25,10/6/22 18:25,162-178,,5-Apr,59,,Methods Inf Med,Patients' Perceptions of Different Information Exchange Mechanisms,,,,,,,en,"Georg Thieme Verlag KG Rüdigerstraße 14, 70469 Stuttgart, Germany",,,,www.thieme-connect.com,,Publisher: Georg Thieme Verlag KG,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/UYUTUXIA/s-0040-1721784.html,,,benefits; health information exchange; information exchange mechanisms; personal health information; risks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the authors predict that the relationship between feelings of violation and CWB-O (or CWB-S) would depend on the extent to which the victim attributed blame to the organization (or supervisor). Using weekly and daily survey data, the study found that identity threat was a stronger mediator for recursive CWB?PCB relationships. Moreover, it was found that PCB related positively to violation feelings, which in turn related positively to CWB-O and CWB-S over time.

As such, employees engaging in these behaviors violate or exceed organizational norms, respectively. An employee’s relationship quality with his or her supervisor [i.e., leader–member exchange (LMX)] has been found to be a prominent antecedent of employees’ workplace behavior. However, the actual mechanisms that link LMX and discretionary behaviors (i.e., CWB and OCB) are not yet well understood. Integrating social exchange as well as the social identity theory, we present an employee’s organizational identification (OI) as a mechanism that sheds light on why LMX leads to employees’ subsequent discretionary behavior. Across four empirical studies employing complementary study designs, we demonstrate that LMX is positively associated with OI, which, in turn, curbs CWB and fosters OCB. Specifically, this pattern of findings is consistent across (1) a cross-sectional study with 188 Swiss employees, (2) a time-lagged study with 502 Swiss employees, (3) an online recall experiment with 131 US participants, and (4) an online vignette experiment with 139 US participants. In sum, we present an integrative theoretical model and respective empirical support to shed light on OI as a pivotal mechanism that can explain why the relationship quality with one’s supervisor can simultaneously serve as a deterrent for CWB and foster OCB.",2020,10/6/22 18:26,10/6/22 18:26,10/6/22 18:26,,,,11,,,Leader–Member Exchange Fosters Beneficial and Prevents Detrimental Workplace Behavior,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/WNZYBNDB/Götz et al_2020_Leader–Member Exchange Fosters Beneficial and Prevents Detrimental Workplace.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on implicit leadership theory, we examine perceptions of leader prototypicality and ratings of leader effectiveness, as predicted by the interacting effects of leader body fat, leader gender, and the performance of the leader's work unit. Our sample consisted of 437 U.S. adults, recruited through Mturk, who evaluated fictitious leaders. Results suggested that leaders were, indeed, subject to statistically significant weight penalties in perceived leader effectiveness, which operated indirectly via decreased perceptions of leader prototypicality. These weight penalties were significantly increased for both man and woman leaders when unit performance was poor. In terms of credit/blame for unit performance, woman leaders with higher body fat received significantly more blame for unit failure, and less credit for unit success, than their counterparts with lower body fat.

Understanding antecedents of faking is thus of utmost importance. Recent theories of faking highlight the central role of various forms of competition for understanding why faking occurs. Drawing on these theories, we suggest that the more applicants adhere to competitive worldviews (CWs), that is, the more they believe that the social world is a competitive, Darwinian-type of struggle over scarce resources, the more likely they are to fake in employment interviews. We tested our hypothesis in three independent studies that were conducted in five different countries. Results show that CWs are strongly associated with faking, independently of job applicants’ cultural and economic context. More specifically, applicants’ CWs explain faking intentions and self-reported past faking above and beyond the Dark Triad of personality (Study 1), competitiveness and the six facets of conscientiousness (Study 2). Also, when faking is measured using a response randomisation technique to control for social desirability, faking is more prevalent among applicants with strong vs. less strong CWs (Study 3). Taken together, this research demonstrates that competition is indeed strongly associated with undesirable applicant behaviors.",2016,10/6/22 18:26,10/22/22 13:14,10/6/22 18:26,643-670,,4,65,,,When Winning is Everything,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/apps.12072,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/GWTEPAUB/Roulin_Krings_2016_When Winning is Everything.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/4KNQTIP9/apps.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One reason for this lack of research is that validated measures that assess different types of sexual harassment experienced by employees working with patients or clients are lacking. In this study, we seek to establish a conceptual framework for investigating extraorganizational sexual harassment in healthcare work. Based on this theoretical framework, we developed and validated a measure for assessing sexually harassing behaviors from patients or clients. Data were gathered from heterogeneous samples of employees working in a variety of settings in healthcare. To evaluate the factorial structure of the measure, we conducted exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using a calibration sample (N = 179) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using a cross-validation sample (N = 305). The construct validity of the measure was demonstrated by investigating relationships with indicators of care workers’ mental health. EFA revealed three factors, namely, nonverbal, verbal, and physical acts of sexual harassment. Examination of the measure comprising 14 items revealed acceptable internal consistencies and substantial correlations with indicators of care workers’ mental health. This study provides a useful and sound measure for assessing sexual harassment from patients or clients and paves the way for the development of a comprehensive theoretical framework for the assessment of sexual harassment. Furthermore, it facilitates future investigations of risk factors for sexual harassment and protective factors helping healthcare workers cope with sexual harassment from patients or clients.",2020-01,10/6/22 18:26,10/6/22 18:26,10/6/22 18:26,2570,,7,17,,,Sexually Harassing Behaviors from Patients or Clients and Care Workers’ Mental Health,,,,,,,en,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,,,,www.mdpi.com,,Number: 7 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/KYMXN9QH/2570.html; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/WJGYMP32/Vincent-Höper et al_2020_Sexually Harassing Behaviors from Patients or Clients and Care Workers’ Mental.pdf,,,measurement; mental health; validation; healthcare; sexual harassment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Time-on-task, story length, and rated creativity scores were obtained for the participants’ stories. The storyboard task demonstrated good alternate form reliability and convergent validity with the criterion measures. Although time-on-task was strongly, positively associated with creativity scores, this relationship was confounded by the contribution of story length. Relationships amongst these variables were similar when creativity was rated by novice raters using a rubric or experienced raters using the consensual assessment technique. Additionally, story length and time-on-task were moderately correlated with the external criterion measures of creativity.

However, the factors influencing the interface management of PBPs are largely unknown and poorly studied. To compensate for this gap, this study aimed to investigate the critical factors influencing interface management in PBPs with quantitative and qualitative methods. Twenty-seven critical factors influencing the interface management of PBPs were identified through a literature review, questionnaire survey, and face-to-face interviews with professionals in the construction industry. A questionnaire survey was sent out to developers, designers, manufacturers, contractors, and consultants in China, and 66 completed questionnaires were received. Results showed the top five critical factors influencing the interface management of PBPs were (1) accuracy of design, (2) timeliness of information communication, (3) timeliness of component production and supply, (4) standardization of design, and (5) definition of work content and scope. The 27 influencing factors of PBPs were further categorized into seven groups via exploratory factor analysis, namely: (1) information communication, (2) trust and cooperation, (3) technical and management capability, (4) organizational integration, (5) standardization, (6) technical environment, and (7) contractual management. Improving these issues will contribute to the successful implementation of PBPs. Finally, combined with relevant literature and expert interviews, the impact of these seven clusters on the interface management of PBPs was discussed. The findings may contribute to deepening the understanding of interface management, reducing unnecessary conflicts and difficulties, and promoting the sustainable development of prefabricated building (PB).",2022-01,10/6/22 18:27,10/6/22 18:27,10/6/22 18:27,5418,,9,14,,,Critical Factors Influencing Interface Management of Prefabricated Building Projects,,,,,,,en,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,,,,www.mdpi.com,,Number: 9 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/38ZMVZU6/5418.html; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/7LWSWANX/Zhang et al_2022_Critical Factors Influencing Interface Management of Prefabricated Building.pdf,,,factor analysis; critical factors; interface management; prefabricated building; sustainable development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability to successfully cope with stress is strongly negatively related to mental health outcomes. Furthermore, recent studies indicate a connection between executive function impairment, anxiety and depression. The current study examines executive functioning (EF), coping, anxiety, and depression in a sample of 210 emerging adults (N Males = 131, Mage = 19.14). Additionally, the relation between EF and coping is explored. Finally, coping’s effect on the relation between EF and outcome (anxiety and depression) is investigated. The results demonstrate that males and females differ on several measures of EF and that this impacts the level of depression or anxiety that they experience. Executive function was found to be related to coping such that individuals with greater impairment engaged more frequently in both disengagement and emotion coping. Furthermore, disengagement coping predicted both anxiety and depression. Executive function impairment emerged as a significant predictor of both anxiety and depression. Additionally, emotion coping moderated the relation between executive function impairment and anxiety. Future research should continue to investigate the relations among executive function, coping, and mental health outcomes in both clinical and nonclinical samples of emerging adults. The gender difference in executive function and its moderating role in predicting outcome require further scrutiny.

Building from learned helplessness, attribution theory of motivation, and consumer power theory, the current research addresses this issue by showing the impact of repeated access denial on perceptions of power and market engagement. Across five repeated-choice experiments utilizing a financial loan context, the authors show that market access and consumer power exist in a feedback loop, with lack of access leading to lower perceptions of power and, consequently, reduced market engagement or detrimental choice in the market. The authors present a norm-based intervention to encourage market engagement among those who have experienced denial by working through beliefs of market success, but demonstrate the detrimental effect of this intervention on those who have experienced repeated access prior to denial. In response, the authors present an education intervention to encourage smarter choices once consumers have entered the market. They conclude with implications for market access policy.",4/1/20,10/6/22 18:27,10/6/22 18:27,10/6/22 18:27,99-118,,2,39,,,Denial Without Determination,,,,,,,en,,,,,SAGE Journals,,Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/LJ46BF6A/Leary_Ridinger_2020_Denial Without Determination.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Researchers are working to identify individual differences that correlate with complacency as one strategy for preventing complacency-related accidents. Automation-induced complacency potential is an individual difference reflecting a general tendency to be complacent across a wide variety of situations which is similar to, but distinct from trust. Accurately assessing complacency potential may improve our ability to predict and prevent complacency in safety-critical occupations. Much past research has employed an existing measure of complacency potential. However, in the 25 years since that scale was published, our conceptual understanding of complacency itself has evolved, and we propose that an updated scale of complacency potential is needed. The goal of the present study was to develop, and provide initial validation evidence for, a new measure of automation-induced complacency potential that parallels the current conceptualization of complacency. In a sample of 475 online respondents, we tested 10 new items and found that they clustered into two separate scales: Alleviating Workload (which focuses on attitudes about the use of automation to ease workloads) and Monitoring (which focuses on attitudes toward monitoring of automation). Alleviating workload correlated moderately with the existing complacency potential rating scale, while monitoring did not. Further, both the alleviating workload and monitoring scales showed discriminant validity from the previous complacency potential scale and from similar constructs, such as propensity to trust. In an initial examination of criterion-related validity, only the monitoring-focused scale had a significant relationship with hypothetical complacency (r = -0.42, p < 0.01), and it had significant incremental validity over and above all other individual difference measures in the study. These results suggest that our new monitoring-related items have potential for use as a measure of automation-induced complacency potential and, compared with similar scales, this new measure may have unique value.",2019,10/6/22 18:27,10/6/22 18:27,10/6/22 18:27,,,,10,,,Automation-Induced Complacency Potential,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/ZU7NH4UV/Merritt et al_2019_Automation-Induced Complacency Potential.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Assessment of the given data interface based on its structure level may give us a better understanding of patients’ attitudes toward information-sharing efforts. The main objective of this study is to examine the effects of data structure on perceptions and attitudes of patients toward the quality of health information that may be shared through HIE networks. Materials and Methods Eight experiments were conducted to examine the impact of different design of information collection interfaces (structured vs. unstructured) to record two types of health information (sensitive vs. non-sensitive) that can be used for two types of sharing purposes (health care vs. marketing). Results Results show that the degree of data entry structure can significantly influence patients’ perceptions of completeness, accuracy, psychological risk, accessibility of data, concise representation, and understandability of health information. Discussion There is a connection between data entry interface design and patients’ perceptions of the quality of health information used in HIE networks, which in turn, could lead to the development of best practices in interface design and data collection techniques. This may also improve interactions between patients and healthcare entities, enhance patients’ attitudes toward data collection procedures and HIE, and help healthcare providers use complete and accurate databases.

However, recent research discovered that many users discontinue using these apps after only a few months. Gamification has been suggested as a technique to increase users’ interactions with apps. Nevertheless, it is still not clear how gamification mechanisms encourage continued use and inspire user self-management. Objective: The main objective of this study was to articulate how gamification mechanisms in studies of designing and using health and fitness apps can contribute to the realization of information technology (IT) identity and positive behavioral outcomes. The broader goal was to shed light on how gamification mechanisms will translate into positive use behaviors in the context of mobile health apps. Methods: Data were collected from 364 users of health and fitness apps through an online survey to empirically examine the proposed model. Results: Based on identity theories, this study suggests the fully mediating role of IT identity to describe how gamification elements can lead to continued intention to use health and fitness apps, and increase users’ tendency for information sharing through the apps. The findings indicate that perceived gamification can increase users’ IT identity. In turn, a higher IT identity would encourage users to continue using the apps and share more personal health information with others through the apps. Conclusions: The results of this study can have practical implications for app designers to use gamification elements to increase users’ dependency, relatedness, and emotional energy associated with health apps. Moreover, the findings can have theoretical contributions for researchers to help better articulate the process in which gamification can be translated into positive use behaviors.",7/5/21,10/6/22 18:27,10/6/22 18:27,10/6/22 18:27,e28282,,3,9,,,The Influence of Gamification and Information Technology Identity on Postadoption Behaviors of Health and Fitness App Users,,,,,,,EN,"This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work, first published JMIR Serious Games, is properly cited.

This study compares the performance of nonparametric person-fit statistics in unfolding and dominance model contexts. Results for dominance data indicate that increases in detection rates depend, among other factors, on type of aberrant responding and person-fit statistic used. The detection of aberrant responses in ideal point data was ineffective using four nonparametric person-fit statistics, with slightly higher type I error and power less than 0.25.

Self-regulation is central to the development and experience of PSMU, and conceptually interrelates with individual usage motivations (Reinecke et al., 2022). While there is a growing body of research on social media use motivations, how usage motivations and self-regulation combined influence PSMU is not well understood. There are also persistent questions around the effectiveness of addiction-based measures of PSMU. The quantitative component of this nested mixed-methods study (N = 607) employed hierarchical regression and structural equation modelling, principally identifying that impulsive social media usage mediates the pathway between perceived executive/attentional functioning and the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS, Andreassen et al., 2012, 2016), a popular tool used to measure PSMU. In contrast, social-engagement motivations had a negative influence on the BSMAS. The qualitative component, comprising interview/open-ended questionnaire, explored individual experiences self-regulating social media use. Participants (N = 24) were recruited from the survey study, based on meeting screening criteria for executive dysfunction (Adult Self-Report ADHD Scale, Kessler et al., 2005), with sub-groups defined by top and bottom quartile BSMAS scores (evenly grouped). Thematic analysis found that most individuals with attention dysregulation, regardless of their BSMAS category, perceive self-regulation of social media use as highly challenging and effortful, describing broadly problematic relationship with social media. They also described rich combination of motivations and context of using social media, and strategies for managing use. This research questions the effectiveness of the BSMAS as a measure of general PSMU (lacking a formed self-regulation component), especially in individuals with attentional dysregulation. Future research investigating self-regulation strategies and focusing on characteristics of positive social media use is needed.",8/8/22,10/6/22 18:40,10/6/22 18:40,10/6/22 18:40,,,,,,Curr Psychol,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,"/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/CXDAQDM9/Arness_Ollis_2022_A mixed-methods study of problematic social media use, attention dysregulation,.pdf",,,Self-regulation; Attentional dysregulation; Problematic social media use (PSMU); Social media addiction; Social media use motives,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Student learning was assessed by way of four distinct learning outcomes that varied according to stakes (low-v. high-stakes) and span (one-time v. aggregated). Participants included high school students between 14 and 18 years of age enrolled in an AP Statistics course (N = 320, M age = 16.76 years, SD age = 0.85; 60.2% female) who had consented to use an online assessment system over the course of an academic year that was designed to provide personalized performance reports. While largely uncorrelated with self-report measures, certain process data variables were significantly correlated with learning outcomes. In particular, students’ frequency of score report checking, an indication of feedback-seeking behavior, while uncorrelated with self-reported student engagement, was associated with all learning outcomes. Other behaviors, such as the number of log-in sessions and the duration of sessions, were not. These findings suggest that process data from online assessment systems can help broaden and deepen our understanding of student behavior above and beyond self-report.

Results showed that self-evaluation activity played a key role in mediating the relationship between learner-controlled practice difficulty and performance in the adaptive transfer trial. Self-evaluation was also found to mediate the relationship between practice difficulty and strategic knowledge. In addition, performance goal orientation moderated the relationship between training design and learner-controlled practice difficulty such that participants in the procedural, error-avoidant condition chose higher levels of practice difficulty on average when mastery goal orientation was low, which suggests a beneficial matching effect for performance oriented individuals in procedural, error avoidant training conditions.

When carried out correctly, socialization is related to better newcomer adjustment (e.g., higher role clarity, self-efficacy, and social acceptance), decreased newcomer turnover, and reduced resources used on future hiring efforts. Much of the extant research has focused on organizational socialization tactics, newcomer information seeking, and newcomer adjustment. Veterans’ (coworkers who socialize newcomers) perceptions during the process have largely been ignored. Using socialization resources theory (SRT) (Saks & Gruman, 2012), the current study examines unexplored relationships between veterans’ perceptions of resources (e.g., assimilation, socialization-related job demands, and knowledge self-efficacy), newcomer adjustment, and veteran well-being and job attitudes (e.g., emotional exhaustion, intent to quit, and affective commitment). Data were collected from 115 matched veteran-newcomer pairs. Results suggest veteran’s assessment knowledge self-efficacy was related to newcomer adjustment and veteran’s well-being and job attitudes during socialization. An interesting non-significant finding was that most veterans (72%) did not perceive socialization as an added socialization-related job demand. This is encouraging because it suggests that veterans could view socialization positively and suggests an area for future research. These findings advance SRT by empirically testing the proposition that veterans are an important social capital resource for newcomers. It also extends SRT as it is one of the first studies to incorporate veteran perceptions of the process. These results provide evidence to organizations that they need to pay attention to the veteran’s role in the socialization process, particularly when it comes to newcomer’s feelings of social acceptance and veteran’s own well-being and job attitudes.",,10/6/22 18:40,10/22/22 20:24,10/6/22 18:40,,,,,,,There are Two Sides to Every Story,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9781369704549,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/4ED6XN9F/Dunn_There are Two Sides to Every Story.pdf,,,Social sciences; Psychology; Veterans; Socialization; Newcomers; Onboarding; Socialization resources theory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following a preliminary validation of the PABUA that involved exploratory factor analysis (Wolk et al., 2016), this study aimed to confirm the factor structure in an independent sample and to further evaluate concurrent and discriminant validity of the subscales: (1) Overprotection, or beliefs that youth should be protected from feeling anxious; (2) Distress, or appraisals of guilt, anxiety/discomfort, helplessness, and avoidance in response to youth anxiety; and (3) Approach, or the belief in the value of promoting autonomy and modeling for/encouraging youth to engage with anxiety-provoking situations. Participants (N = 207; 70% female; 87.4% White; 91.8% non-Hispanic) were caregivers of a child 6 to 17 years old with clinical levels of anxiety (based on SCARED-P score 25) and were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk.

Results of confirmatory factor analysis with diagonally least weighted squares estimation supported the initial three-factor model, with some items removed (model fit indices: CFI: .98; TLI: .98; RMSEA: .06; SRMR: .08). There were 8 items on Overprotection (ω = .88), 5 items on Distress (ω = .66), and 3 items on Approach – which did not meet the standard for acceptable internal consistency. There was also support for a two-factor model that excludes the Approach scale (model fit indices: CFI: .99; TLI: .99; RMSEA: .05; SRMR: .07), with improved internal consistency for the Distress subscale (Overprotection: ω = .85; Distress: ω = .68). Correlational analysis to examine concurrent and discriminant validity generally replicated findings from the initial validation study. For example, using scales based on the two-factor model, PABUA Overprotection was more strongly associated with a measure of unwillingness to experience a child’s negative emotion (r = .50, p < .01) than was PABUA Distress (r = .27, p <.05); whereas PABUA Distress was more strongly associated with a measure of caregiver inability to manage their reaction to a child’s negative emotion (r = .61, p < .01) than was PAUBA Overprotection (r = .32, p < .01). The PABUA can be used to study the impact of caregiver beliefs on a child’s anxiety and may allow for systematic assessment of family-based treatment targets. Efforts to refine the PABUA should focus on expanding the Approach subscale and reconsidering item anchors to increase variability in responses.",2022,10/6/22 18:41,10/22/22 20:28,10/6/22 18:41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798426822283,,"/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/RGXLWG74/Boyd_2022_Confirmatory Factor Analysis of the Parental Attitudes, Beliefs, and.pdf",,,Adolescent; Assessment; Anxiety; Child,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In many application domains, critical systems must comply with safety standards. This involves gathering safety evidence in the form of artefacts such as safety analyses, system specifications, and testing results. These artefacts can evolve during a system's lifecycle, creating a need for change impact analysis to guarantee that system safety and compliance are not jeopardised. Objective. We aim to provide new insights into how safety evidence change impact analysis is addressed in practice. The knowledge about this activity is limited despite the extensive research that has been conducted on change impact analysis and on safety evidence management. Method. We conducted an industrial survey on the circumstances under which safety evidence change impact analysis is addressed, the tool support used, and the challenges faced. Results. We obtained 97 valid responses representing 16 application domains, 28 countries, and 47 safety standards. The respondents had most often performed safety evidence change impact analysis during system development, from system specifications, and fully manually. No commercial change impact analysis tool was reported as used for all artefact types and insufficient tool support was the most frequent challenge. Conclusion. The results suggest that the different artefact types used as safety evidence co-evolve. In addition, the evolution of safety cases should probably be better managed, the level of automation in safety evidence change impact analysis is low, and the state of the practice can benefit from over 20 improvement areas.",2016-12,10/6/22 18:41,10/6/22 18:41,,1095-1117,,12,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/M6TQSGWK/de la Vara et al_2016_An Industrial Survey of Safety Evidence Change Impact Analysis Practice.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/DWCH8WMY/7450627.html,,,survey research; Market research; Best practices; Safety; Certification; change impact analysis; Industries; safety evidence; Safety-critical system; Standards; state of the practice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The findings revealed that relevant processes were associated with idiosyncratic implicature questions, while irrelevant processes were related to formulaic implicature ones.

Moreover, test takers’ cognitive processes aligned with the test results on the whole.

Morgan and Jerry J. Sweet (see record [rid]2008-13456-000[/rid]). Clinical neuropsychologists frequently evaluate individuals within a forensic context, and therefore must address questions regarding the possible presence of insufficient effort, response bias, and/or malingering. This volume offers a wide range of instructive real-world case examples involving the complex differential diagnosis where symptom exaggeration and/or malingering cloud the picture. Written by expert forensic neuropsychologists, the scenarios described provide informed, empirically-based, and scientifically-derived opinions on the topic. Issues related to malingering, such as response bias and insufficient effort, are discussed thoroughly with regard to a large number of clinical conditions and assessment instruments. Test data and non-test information are considered and integrated by the numerous experts. Expert guidance for clinicians and graduate students who must address the issue of malingering is provided in a straightforward and well-organized format. To date, there has not been a comparable collection of rich case material relevant to forensic practice in clinical neuropsychology.

Given well‐established rates of 10 to 30% poor effort in clinical settings, this is not a trivial concern. This preliminary study evaluated effort during cognitive testing in an RCT of omega‐3 supplementation to reduce suicidality in a high‐risk psychiatric population. An interim analysis of sustained attentions measures from the Connors Performance Test (CPT‐2) at baseline for the first 60 participants was conducted. Previously validated cut points to detect insufficient effort on the CPT‐2 were applied. At baseline, 12% (7) were identified as giving poor effort. Follow‐up analyses indicated less psychiatric distress and suicidality among those who gave poor effort. Results suggest comparable likelihood of a poor effort on cognitive testing in clinical and RCT participation. Reduced psychiatric distress in the poor effort group raises concern regarding interpretation of other measures. The importance of screening cognitive data for effort in RCTs is highlighted.

In this study, we examine the impact of two techniques to account for test disengagement—(a) removing unengaged test takers from the sample and (b) adjusting test scores to remove rapidly guessed items—on estimates of school contributions to student growth, achievement gaps, and summer learning loss.

The Conscientious Responders Scale (CRS) is a five-item validity measure that uses instructional items to identify responders. Because each item instructs responders exactly how to answer that particular item, each response can be scored as either correct or incorrect. Given the long odds of answering a CRS item correctly by chance alone on a 7-point scale (14.29%), we reasoned that RRs would answer most items incorrectly, whereas CRs would answer them correctly. This rationale was evaluated in two experiments in which CRs’ CRS scores were compared against RRs’ scores. As predicted, results showed large differences in CRS scores across responder groups. Moreover, the CRS correctly classified responders as either conscientious or random with greater than 93% accuracy. Implications for the reliability and effectiveness of the CRS are discussed.",7/1/14,10/19/22 0:51,10/19/22 0:51,10/19/22 0:51,2.15824E+14,,3,4,,SAGE Open,The Conscientious Responders Scale,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/K9TZ9LPA/The Conscientious Responders Scale A New Tool for.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Study 1 tests its sensitivity to questionnaire length, a known cause of IR, and tries to provoke IR by manipulating psychological reactance. As expected, short questionnaires produced higher Conscientious Responders Scale scores than long questionnaires, and Conscientious Responders Scale scores were unaffected by reactance manipulations. Study 2 tests concerns that the Conscientious Responders Scale’s unusual item content could potentially irritate and baffle responders, ironically increasing rates of IR. We administered two nearly identical questionnaires: one with an embedded Conscientious Responders Scale and one without the Conscientious Responders Scale. Psychometric comparisons revealed no differences across questionnaires’ means, variances, interitem response consistencies, and Cronbach’s alphas.

The open science study was co-designed by an international consortium of researchers to investigate how psychological responses differ across countries and cultures, and how this has impacted behaviour, coping and trust in government efforts to slow the spread of the virus. Starting in March 2020, COVIDiSTRESS leveraged the convenience of unpaid online recruitment to generate public data. The objective of the present analysis is to understand relationships between psychological responses in the early months of global coronavirus restrictions and help understand how different government measures succeed or fail in changing public behaviour. There were variations between and within countries. Although Western Europeans registered as more concerned over COVID-19, more stressed, and having slightly more trust in the governments' efforts, there was no clear geographical pattern in compliance with behavioural measures. Detailed plots illustrating between-countries differences are provided. Using both traditional and Bayesian analyses, we found that individuals who worried about getting sick worked harder to protect themselves and others. However, concern about the coronavirus itself did not account for all of the variances in experienced stress during the early months of COVID-19 restrictions. More alarmingly, such stress was associated with less compliance. Further, those most concerned over the coronavirus trusted in government measures primarily where policies were strict. While concern over a disease is a source of mental distress, other factors including strictness of protective measures, social support and personal lockdown conditions must also be taken into consideration to fully appreciate the psychological impact of COVID-19 and to understand why some people fail to follow behavioural guidelines intended to protect themselves and others from infection.

Research participants who are unmotivated to perform well can engage in random responding on outcome measures, which can cause substantial mis-estimation of results, biasing results toward the null hypothesis. Data from a recent educational intervention study served as an example of this problem: participants identified as random responders showed substantially lower scores than other participants on tests during the study, and failed to show growth in scores from pre- to post-test, while those not engaging in random responding showed much higher scores and significant growth over time. Furthermore, the hypothesized differences across instructional method were masked when random responders were retained in the sample but were significant when removed. We remind researchers in the social sciences to screen their data for random responding in their outcome measures in order to improve the odds of detecting effects of their interventions.",2011,10/19/22 0:56,10/19/22 0:56,10/19/22 0:56,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/T6IJI7NG/Osborne_Blanchard_2011_Random Responding from Participants is a Threat to the Validity of Social.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A new measure, the Acquired Capability With Rehearsal for Suicide Scale (ACWRSS), was devised to capture the key facets of acquired capability—pain tolerance and fearlessness of death—while also incorporating deliberate and active means to increase preparedness for suicide. The factor structure of the ACWRSS was tested using confirmatory factor analysis (n = 611). The 7-item ACWRSS conformed to the hypothesized 3-factor structure, demonstrating excellent fit and good internal consistency (α = .83). Measurement invariance across gender was also demonstrated on configural, metric, and scalar levels. Next, in the first longitudinal study of the association between acquired capability and suicide ideation, intention, and readiness (n = 234), the acquired capability facets prospectively predicted specific phases in the motivational-volitional pathway toward suicide readiness. Moreover, 2 of the acquired capability components mediated the relationship between baseline nonsuicidal self-injury and suicide readiness at follow-up. In an inpatient psychiatric sample (n = 108), the ACWRSS was significantly correlated with prior suicide attempts and thoughts and episodes of nonsuicidal self-injury, and its facets demonstrated differential sensitivity to change. The ACWRSS is the first measure of acquired capability that reliably and validly captures all key facets of this critical component of the interpersonal theory of suicide. Its brevity enhances its utility for both research and clinical settings.

The Crosswise Model (CWM; Yu et al., Metrika, 67, 251-263, 2008) and its extension, the Extended Crosswise Model (ECWM; Heck et al., Behavior Research Methods, 50, 1895-1905, 2018), are advancements of the Randomized Response Technique that have provided promising results in terms of improved validity of the obtained prevalence estimates compared to estimates based on conventional direct questions. However, recent studies have raised the question as to whether these promising results might have been primarily driven by a methodological artifact in terms of random responses rather than a successful control of socially desirable responding. The current study was designed to disentangle the influence of successful control of socially desirable responding and random answer behavior on the validity of (E)CWM estimates. To this end, we orthogonally manipulated the direction of social desirability (undesirable vs. desirable) and the prevalence (high vs. low) of sensitive attributes. Our results generally support the notion that the ECWM successfully controls social desirability bias and is inconsistent with the alternative account that ECWM estimates are distorted by a substantial influence of random responding.

Moreover, field studies can help extend psychological research in valuable ways to applied domains such as health, law, education, and business.

In recent years, researchers have devoted greater attention to the response bias of insufficient effort responding (IER), in which participants fail to attend to instructions, do not read item content carefully, or intentionally engage in random responding (see Huang, Liu, & Bowling, 2015). While IER has often been considered a purely methodological concern, recent research has begun to examine whether it also has a substantive basis (e.g., personality, see Bowling et al., 2016). Here we examine the possibility that IER on Conditional Reasoning Tests of Aggression (CRTAs) can be a function of the very construct of interest, latent aggression. In three studies, we demonstrate that higher levels of latent aggression are indeed related to IER. In particular, we show that the justification mechanism known as “victimization by powerful others” is the strongest determinant of IER. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that IER, as measured by the CRTA in the form of selecting illogical responses to CRTA items, can be a powerful predictor of important behavioral outcomes.

Main outcome measure The proportion of completed or partially completed questionnaires returned. Results The odds of response were more than doubled when a monetary incentive was used (odds ratio 2.02; 95% confidence interval 1.79 to 2.27) and almost doubled when incentives were not conditional on response (1.71; 1.29 to 2.26).

Inadequate health literacy and higher disease information avoidance may suppress risk knowledge and thereby increase DK responding. Study goals were to examine two plausible interventions to address the health education needs of DK responders. Design: Participants were identified in a pre-screener as DK responders for either diabetes or colorectal cancer (CRC) risk perception questions (N = 1276; 35% non-white; 49% inadequate health literacy). They were randomly assigned to read either standard or low literacy risk information about diabetes or CRC, and to undergo a self-affirmation intervention or not. Main outcome measure: DK responding following reading the risk information. Results: Neither intervention reduced DK responding. Multivariable analyses showed that health literacy, information avoidance and believing the disease is unpredictable – but not risk factor knowledge and need for cognition – best predicted participants’ conversion from a DK response to a non-DK scale point response. Conclusion: Results confirm that both inadequate health literacy and higher information avoidance are associated with DK responding. DK responders are also disproportionately underserved and less adherent to health behaviors.

Although not all delay is procrastination, a consistent and clear component of all procrastination is conscious delay. Knowing that emergent adults are transitioning from parental supervision to self-regulation during college years, we examined their delay behaviors in multiple domains to get a wider perspective. We also examined the association of these reported delays with their perceptions of parenting they received during their teen years. Participants (N = 442) were recruited from a regional midwestern university and completed a 20-minute online survey anonymously. The survey included a newly developed Multidomain Delay Scale (MDS) to assess delay in six domains of goal pursuit (work, home, health, social, financial, and academic). They also completed a trait measure of procrastination, as well as measures of parenting dimensions (promotion of autonomous thinking and decision-making, and exertion of psychological and behavioral control). Repeated-measures ANOVA indicated significant differences in how much young adults delay tasks in different domains. Gender differences were minimal. Participants showed the lowest average delay in work and the highest in health. Correlations between procrastination, domain-specific delays, and parental dimensions were statistically significant. Parental support of autonomous thinking and decision-making, as well as exertion of behavioral control during teen years, were associated with lower delay and less procrastination in young adults.

Data collected through an online crowdsource platform from 212 adult clients in individual psychotherapy were analyzed using polynomial regression and response surface analysis. Results indicated that clients who perceived greater similarity to their therapists at higher (vs. lower) levels of Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience reported stronger real relationships, as did clients who perceived greater similarity at lower (vs. higher) levels of Neuroticism. Similarly, clients reported a stronger real relationship when they perceived their therapists as similarly high in Extraversion, but the real relationship decreased slightly when the similarity was perceived at higher (vs. moderate) levels of this trait. Perceived similarity at high and low levels of Agreeableness was also associated with stronger real relationships. There was no evidence of an indirect association between client-perceived similarity and treatment progress via the real relationship. However, clients who perceived greater similarity to their therapists at higher (vs. lower) levels of Openness to Experiences and Conscientiousness reported more progress in treatment.

To determine the prevalence and consequences of inattention bias in surveys, we estimate how meat demand varies across people who do and do not miss trap questions. Using a split-sample design with discrete choice experiments for meat products, we explore three different trap questions to determine how many potentially inattentive respondents are identified by each method. We find that individuals who miss trap questions respond differently to the choice experiment than individuals who correctly answer the trap question. Inattention generates vastly different compensating variation estimates of a carbon tax, ranging from 3.56 cents per meal choice for the least attentive to 6.13 cents per meal choice for the most attentive.",3/1/18,10/19/22 1:24,10/19/22 1:24,10/19/22 1:24,218-230,,,145,,Ecological Economics,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/NJMF9P4X/Malone_Lusk_2018_Consequences of Participant Inattention with an Application to Carbon Taxes for.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/5TDQEVVI/S0921800916313374.html,,,Discrete choice experiment; Inattention bias; Meat demand; Trap question,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this article, we ask whether there is a third way: can inattentive respondents be induced to pay attention? Using three different strategies across three studies, we show that while such inducements increase attention check passage, they do not reduce noise in descriptive or experimental survey items. In addition, the inducements cause some respondents to drop out of the survey. These results have important implications for applied research.

One common type of metadata is item response time. While response times have been used extensively to improve estimates of achievement, little work considers whether these metadata may provide useful information on social–emotional constructs. This study uses an analytic example to explore whether metadata might help illuminate such constructs. Specifically, analyses examine whether the amount of time students spend on test items (after accounting for item difficulty and estimates of true achievement), and difficult items in particular, tell us anything about the student's academic motivation and self-efficacy. While results do not indicate a strong relationship between mean item durations and these constructs in general, the amount of time students spend on very difficult items is highly correlated with motivation and self-efficacy.

Results show that entrepreneurial identity aspirations were more strongly positively related to entrepreneurial discovery behaviors among employees who experienced a displacing work event in their current workplace; discovery behaviors in turn related to entrepreneurial exploitation behaviors. The moderation effect was significant for four of the six displacing events examined in this study.

One general method involved obtaining from employees measures that assessed background, performance, and organizational information. This information could be used to identify respondents who were knowledgeable about the job and, therefore, able to rate the job accurately. A second general method involved collecting job-analysis data from all potential job-analysis respondents and, on the basis of indices computed on these data, selecting a subsample from them. Two indices were investigated: (1) the D index, which assessed similarity between an individual's ratings and the population's mean ratings, and (2) the carelessness index, which measured an individual's tendency to rate tasks known to be unrelated to the focal job as important. Both methods were applied to a sample of 343 mental-health workers. Four general postulates for job analysts were proposed on the basis of the results: (1) Different selection measures yield somewhat different job-analysis respondents. (2) Respondents are not equally accurate and, with the use of the carelessness index, may be screened for the tendency to make errors. (3) In some applications, the number of sampled respondents needs to be greater than three in order to obtain reliable results.

We review the literature and distinguish three incongruent theories: (a) Malicious Envy Theory (i.e., envy as uniform and malicious), (b) Dual Envy Theory (i.e., envy as taking on 2 forms, benign and malicious), and (c) Pain Theory of Envy (i.e., envy as uniform and driven by pain). Moreover, within and across theories, operationalizations of envy have included various different components. We integrate these conceptualizations using a data-driven approach, deriving a comprehensive theory of envy in 5 studies (total N = 1,237)—the Pain-driven Dual Envy (PaDE) Theory. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of an exhaustive set of envy components (Studies 1–4) suggest that envy consists of 3 factors: Pain (i.e., preoccupation with the envy-eliciting situation, inferiority), predicts both benign envy (i.e., desire for the envy object, improvement motivation, emulation of the other), and malicious envy (i.e., communication about the other, directed aggression, nondirected aggression). An experience-sampling study (Study 5) suggests that pain constitutes a quickly fading reaction, whereas benign and malicious envy are enduring attitudinal constructs. We apply this theory in a meta-analysis on the controversial relation of envy and schadenfreude (N = 4,366), finding that envy and schadenfreude are more strongly and positively correlated to the extent that the respective research operationalizes envy as malicious, compared with as pain or benign envy. We discuss how the PaDE Theory can illuminate research on envy in diverse settings, and envy’s relation to other distinct emotions.

These games not only afford a novel gaming experience but also have the potential to alter how players view their physical realities. In addition to the common experiences and gratifications people derive from games, (location-based) ARGs can afford, for example outdoor adventures, communal activities, and health benefits, but also create problems stemming from, for example privacy concerns and poor usability. This raises some important research questions as to what drives people to use these new applications, and why they may be willing to spend money on the content sold within them. In this study, we investigate the various gratifications people derive from ARGs (Pokémon Go) and the relationship of these gratifications with the players’ intentions to continue playing and spending money on them.

However, only recently, have researchers begun to acknowledge prosocial behaviors that help maintain an organization’s positive image in ways that violate ethical norms (e.g., misrepresenting or exaggerating the truth, concealing damaging information about the firm). Recent scandals, including Volkswagen’s emissions scandal and Penn State’s child sex abuse scandal, point to the need for research on the individual factors and situational conditions that shape the emergence of these unethical pro-organizational behaviors (UPB). Drawing on trait activation theory, we argue that the “dark” trait of Machiavellianism should make individuals more willing to engage in UPB. Further, we argue that this willingness will be augmented when Machiavellians hold bottom-line-mentality climate perceptions (BLMCPs), or the perception that ethical standards matter less than organizational performance. Using data from 170 U.S. employees, results suggested that Machiavellians are more willing to engage in UPB, but that BLMCPs may not affect their motivation to engage in UPB.

Its 2 distinct forms are directed at changing this situation in different ways, either by becoming as successful as the envied person (in benign envy) or by lowering the envied person’s advantage (in malicious envy). In essence, envy is thus a social phenomenon. Nevertheless, most previous research has focused on its underlying intrapersonal processes, overlooking envy’s interpersonal core. In contrast, we show in 6 studies (N = 1,513) that envy and pride are intertwined in a social-functional relationship. Envy and pride often co-occur (Study 1) and pride displays enhance envious feelings (Studies 2 and 3). Specifically, authentic (success attributed to effort) and hubristic pride (success attributed to talent) modulate envious intentions and behavior toward their benign and malicious form (Study 2 to 6). This effect is mediated via liking, perceived prestige, and perceived dominance (Study 4). In accordance with a social-functional approach, the effects emerge only when authentic and hubristic pride are expressed by the superior person and not when the respective information about the superior person’s feelings is simply available in the environment (Study 5). These effects are present when participants recall envy situations (Study 1), when they imagine being in a competitive situation (Studies 3, 4, and 5), or when envy is elicited in situ (Studies 2 and 6). Our findings show the value of studying envy as a social phenomenon and open up numerous avenues for research on envy at the interpersonal and intergroup level.

Dispositional benign and malicious envy uniquely predict envious responding following upward social comparisons. Furthermore, they are differentially connected to hope for success and fear of failure.

We present the results of three studies assessing its psychometric validity. Our results indicate that the Scientific Reasoning Scale (SRS) is internally consistent and distinct from extant measures of scientific literacy. Participants with higher SRS scores are more likely to have beliefs consistent with the scientific consensus on potentially contentious issues, above and beyond education, political and religious beliefs, and scores on two widely used measures of scientific literacy. Participants with higher SRS scores also had better performance on a task requiring them to analyze scientific information.

Integrating paradox theory and social cognitive theory, we conceptualize creativity as a process that involves tensions among competing goals and demands, and those tensions become salient under high workload pressure. We propose that learning to constructively deal with such salient tensions is important for the development of creativity and that paradoxical leader behavior (PLB) may stimulate creativity by enhancing employees’ creative self-efficacy (CSE) in such challenging situations. However, PLB will only promote CSE and employee creativity when employees have a high level of integrative complexity to accept and appreciate the complex and paradoxical behaviors of the leader. Based on data from 252 employee-supervisor dyads, we found that through CSE, PLB was most effective in promoting employee creativity when workload pressure and integrative complexity were both high. However, PLB was less effective for promoting CSE and creativity when workload pressure was low, or when workload pressure was high while integrative complexity was low.

Integrating relational mentoring with relational systems theory, we first examined whether the presence of a high-quality mentoring relationship buffers employees in a sample of 3,813 workers. In support of the “mentors-as-buffers” hypothesis, we found that employees who witnessed or were aware of racial discrimination at work had lower organizational commitment than those not exposed, but employees with high-quality mentoring relationships experienced less loss of commitment than those lacking mentors. We then examined the specific buffering behaviors used by mentors in high-quality relationships and whether these behaviors were effective for other work relationships and outcomes. Applying Kahn's typology, we developed and validated a measure of high-quality relational holding behaviors in a sample of 262 workers. Using this measure in a third sample of 557 workers, we found that mentors buffer by providing holding behaviors, but we did not find this buffering effect when supervisors or coworkers provided holding behaviors.

CVS occurs when an individual mentions a charity on their Facebook profile. We investigate need for uniqueness (NFU) and attention to social comparison information (ATSCI) as antecedents of two types of CVS–self-oriented (to gain intrinsic benefits) and other-oriented (to impress others). We also explore the relationship between CVS and self-esteem, and offline prosocial (donation to the charity) and unethical (counterfeit purchase) behaviour intentions. Data from two studies, a college survey (N = 234) and an adult survey via MTurk (N = 296), were analysed using structural equation modelling. Results indicate that NFU predicts both forms of CVS, while ATSCI influences both forms of CVS for adults and other-oriented CVS for students. Self-esteem is enhanced by self-oriented CVS. Self-oriented CVS predicts donation intention whereas other-oriented CVS significantly reduces donation intention for both samples. Furthermore, a significant relationship between CVS and purchase intention of counterfeit luxury goods is revealed. Findings provide insights into conspicuous virtue signalling and the relationship between CVS on Facebook and offline behavioural intentions.",3/1/20,10/21/22 1:07,10/21/22 1:07,10/21/22 1:07,577-592,,3,162,,J Bus Ethics,‘Consuming Good’ on Social Media,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/QQDPADXY/Wallace et al_2020_‘Consuming Good’ on Social Media.pdf,,,Attention to social comparison information; Conspicuous donation behaviour; Conspicuous virtue signalling; Counterfeit purchase intention; Donation intention; Need for uniqueness; Self-esteem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We employed a three-study research design combining two experimental studies and a two-wave field study with business leaders (overall N = 344). Overall transformational leadership resulted in higher evaluations of promotability due to higher perceptions of leaders’ communality and leadership effectiveness. Importantly, these effects were stronger for men, and men showing transformational leadership were evaluated to be more promotable than women. This implies a communality-bonus effect for male transformational leaders. There was no difference in promotability evaluations for women versus men showing autocratic leadership.

We draw from research on subordinates’ implicit theories of leader behavior, behaviorally anchored rating scales, and decision making to argue that leader affect (i.e., the degree to which subordinates have positive and negative feelings about their supervisors) underlies the common variance shared by many leadership measures. To explore this possibility, we developed and validated measures of positive and negative leader affect (i.e., the Leader Affect Questionnaires; LAQs). We conducted 10 studies to develop the five-item positive and negative LAQs and to examine their convergent, discriminant, predictive, and criterion-related validity. We conclude that a) the LAQs provide highly reliable and valid tools for assessing subordinates’ evaluations of their leaders; b) there is significant overlap between existing leadership measures, and a large proportion of this overlap is a function of the affect captured by the LAQs; c) when the LAQs are used as control variables, in most cases, they reduce the strength of relationships between leadership measures and other variables; d) the LAQs account for significant variance in outcomes beyond that explained by other leadership measures; and e) there is a considerable amount of unexplained variance between leadership measures that the LAQs do not capture.

Building on social learning theory, we argue that when supervisors perceive their managers as trustworthy, subordinates are more likely to also perceive their supervisor as trustworthy, which in turn enhances subordinate performance. We further argue that this trickle-down effect of trustworthiness perceptions emerges especially when the manager invites the supervisor to participate in decision-making. Finally, we propose that social learning processes that lead to supervisors exhibiting more trusting behavior toward their subordinates mediate this trickle-down effect. We find support for our predictions across one multisource field study (Study 1) and two experiments (Studies 2 and 3) that both use a yoked design. This research represents the first attempt to examine trickle-down effects related to trustworthiness, its impact on performance, and the mediating mechanisms by which those effects emerge.

This study fills a gap in the literature and addresses shortcomings seen in previous research on healthcare professionals’ attitudes toward the LGBT population. The authors surveyed 243 healthcare workers, including 83 nurses, 60 doctoral-level healthcare professionals, and 100 other healthcare workers using the Transgender Attitudes and Beliefs Scale (TABS). Results of two-way ANOVAs showed that healthcare professionals on the whole hold generally favorable attitudes toward transgender persons with no differences in attitudes across professions. The current study found gender differences in attitudes consonant with previous findings, with females displaying more-accepting attitudes toward transgender individuals compared to their male counterparts. A chi-square test for independence also found changes in healthcare professionals’ views regarding sex reassignment surgery and mental health potential for transgender persons over the past 30 years. The paper includes discussion of earlier studies along with hypothesized and known correlates of attitudes towards transgender persons in an effort to inform possible strategies to improve healthcare for transgender persons.",10/1/16,10/21/22 1:13,10/21/22 1:13,10/21/22 1:13,165-175,,4-Mar,17,,,"Big changes, but are they big enough?",,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/15532739.2016.1232628,,"/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/P3NRMXDY/Kanamori_Cornelius-White_2016_Big changes, but are they big enough.pdf",,,"Attitudes; healthcare; cultural competence; transgender, transphobia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fairness-based explanations for this scorn suggest AA policies provide preferential treatment to minorities, violating procedural fairness principles of consistent treatment. In other words, to promote equality in the workplace, effective AA policies promote inequality when selecting employees, and the broader public perceives this to be procedurally unfair. Given this inconsistency underlies negative reactions to AA policies, we argue that better preparing individuals to deal with inconsistencies can mitigate negative reactions to AA policies. Integrating theories from the fairness and cognitive styles literature, we demonstrate across 4 studies how dialectical thinking—a cognitive style associated with accepting inconsistencies in one’s environment—increases support for AA policies via procedural fairness perceptions. Specifically, we found support for our propositions across a variety of AA policy types (i.e., strong and weak preference policies) and when conceptualizing dialectical thinking either as an individual difference or as a state that can be primed—including being primed by the framing of the AA policy itself. We discuss theoretical contributions and insights for policy-making at government and organizational levels.

Some emerging findings provide cause for optimism with nonverbal, and unobtrusive measures of behavior. This paper extends this work by adopting methods from behavioral economics to examine more deliberative behavior. Participants believed they were playing a prisoner?s dilemma with an outgroup member. They could choose whether to cooperate or compete with the other player. In three studies, we provide reliable evidence that imagined contact (vs. control) successfully encouraged more prosocial, cooperative choices.

Specifically, we propose that abusive supervisory behavior is positively related to supervisors’ state sense of power, which in turn positively relates to their managerial self-efficacy and task-oriented leadership behavior. Furthermore, the relationship between abusive supervisory behavior and state sense of power and the positive indirect effect of abusive supervisory behavior on managerial self-efficacy via state sense of power are stronger for supervisors with low, rather than high, levels of chronic sense of power. Our hypotheses are substantially supported by a multi-wave field diary study (Study 1) conducted across 10 consecutive workdays and three experiments (Studies 2a, 2b, and 3).

We introduce the construct of synchrony preference, an individual difference that describes a willingness to adapt one's pace and rhythm within social interactions for the purpose of creating synchrony with others. We develop a measure of synchrony preference that we validate using multiple methods across 4 studies and 7 samples, which include over 1,400 individuals.

In the present studies, we examined whether these relationships extend to friendship selection and how the number of options for friends moderated these effects. Across 5 studies, maximizing in selecting friends was negatively related to life satisfaction, positive affect, and self-esteem, and was positively related to negative affect and regret. In Study 1, a maximizing in selecting friends scale was created, and regret mediated the relationships between maximizing and well-being. In a naturalistic setting in Studies 2a and 2b, the tendency to maximize among those who participated in the fraternity and sorority recruitment process was negatively related to satisfaction with their selection, and positively related to regret and negative affect. In Study 3, daily levels of maximizing were negatively related to daily well-being, and these relationships were mediated by daily regret. In Study 4, we extended the findings to samples from the U.S. and Japan. When participants who tended to maximize were faced with many choices, operationalized as the daily number of friends met (Study 3) and relational mobility (Study 4), the opportunities to regret a decision increased and further diminished well-being. These findings imply that, paradoxically, attempts to maximize when selecting potential friends is detrimental to one’s well-being.

How do employees perceive and respond to supervisors who treat the bottom line as more important than anything else? Supervisors who hold a bottom-line mentality (BLM) neglect competing priorities such as employee well-being and ethical practices to focus on securing bottom-line success. We find high-BLM supervisors serve as low-quality exchange partners with their employees, resulting in employee perceptions of low-quality leader-member exchange (LMX) relationships. In turn, employees reciprocate by withholding the very thing the supervisor desires?performance?in order to maintain balance in the exchange relationship. As such, supervisors who possess a BLM could actually be negatively impacting the organization?s bottom line through the harmful social exchange relationships they engender with their employees and their impact on employee task performance. We also examine the moderating role of employee BLM on these relationships. When employee BLM is low, we observe a greater negative effect on employee value judgments of the supervisor (i.e. reduced LMX perceptions) and lower employee performance.

Study 1 established a relationship between sleepiness and interpretive bias using ambiguous interpersonal scenarios from a measure commonly used in personnel selection (N = 148). Study 2 explored the boundary conditions of the sleepiness–interpretive bias link via an experimental online field survey of U.S. adults (N = 433). Sleepiness increased interpretive bias when social threats were clearly present (unfair workplace) but did not affect bias in the absence of threat (fair workplace). Study 3 replicated and extended findings from the previous two studies using objective measures of sleep loss and a quasi-experimental manipulation of minor sleep loss (N = 175). Negative affect, ego depletion, or personality variables did not influence the observed relationships. Overall, results suggest that a self-protection/evolutionary perspective best explains the effects of sleepiness on workplace interpretive biases. These studies advance the current research on sleep in organizations by adding a cognitive “threat interpretation” bias approach to past work examining the emotional reaction/behavioral side of sleep disruption. Interpretive biases due to sleepiness may have significant implications for employee health and counterproductive behavior.

Building on social exchange theory and social status literature, we identify three types of favor giving among group members (generous, stingy, and matched) and propose that an affective mechanism (i.e., gratitude) and a cognitive mechanism (i.e., perceived competence) underlie the relationship between favor giving and status attainment. Specifically, generous/stingy favor giving has a linear relationship with status attainment through both gratitude and perceived competence, whereas matched favor giving has a curvilinear relationship with status attainment only through perceived competence. An experimental study and a field study lend support to our propositions. Our study complements the literature by offering a complete picture of how three types of favor giving among group members shape their social status in different ways.

We find support for our hypotheses in four studies examining Canadian (three studies) and American (one study) EE policies. Overall, we found that reminders of past injustice toward women undermined men’s support for an EE policy promoting women by heightening their denial of current gender discrimination.

The present study aims to shed light on this relation by investigating the mediating role of four self-control strategies: situation selection, attentional deployment, reappraisal, and inhibition. To test the hypothesis that self-control strategies mediate trait self-control’s effect on well-being, an online questionnaire on trait self-control, self-control strategies, and cognitive and affective well-being was administered to 4,036 participants from four countries (ages 18–65 and 56.4% female), whose responses were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Our analysis replicates previous studies that trait self-control positively relates to subjective well-being. Moreover, our analysis provides evidence that this relation is indeed mediated by the tendency to employ particular self-control strategies. Attentional deployment and reappraisal positively relate to subjective well-being, whereas inhibition exhibits a negative relation. Situation selection was unrelated to subjective well-being. The incorporation of self-control strategies represents the first attempt to empirically disentangle the positive relation between trait self-control and subjective well-being.

Thus, cultivating employees’ experiences of gratitude represents an important imperative in modern organizations that rely on teamwork and collaboration to achieve organizational goals. Yet, today’s workplace presents a complex array of demands that make it difficult for employees to fully attend to and appreciate the various benefits they receive at work. As such, gratitude is difficult for employers to promote and for employees to experience. Despite these observations, the role of attention and awareness in facilitating employees’ feelings of gratitude is largely overlooked in the extant literature. In this study, we examined whether one notable form of present moment attention, mindfulness, may promote helping behavior by stimulating the positive, other-oriented emotion of gratitude. Across two experimental studies, a semiweekly, multisource diary study, and a 10-day experience sampling investigation, we found converging evidence for a serial mediation model in which state mindfulness, via positive affect and perspective taking, prompts greater levels of gratitude, prosocial motivation, and, in turn, helping behavior at work.

Perceived riskiness is defined as the degree of uncertainty and the significance of the outcomes from the selection decision. Hypotheses that perceived riskiness is a mediator between a candidate's qualifications and selection as well as salary offer, and that gender moderates those relationships, were examined through structural equation modeling and logistic regression. A sample of 253 individuals with prior experience in hiring and promotion decisions responded to an online survey where they read a job description and candidate profile summary of one of the following: a highly qualified female, a highly qualified male, a moderately qualified female, or a moderately qualified male. The results demonstrated a complementary mediating effect of perceived riskiness between a candidate's qualifications and their selection, and between a candidate's qualifications and their salary offer. In addition, gender moderates the pathway from qualifications to perceived riskiness in that highly qualified women were perceived as less risky for senior leadership than highly qualified men, while moderately qualified women were seen as riskier for senior leadership than moderately qualified men.

Although prior research demonstrates that salespeople’s emotional exhaustion can have negative consequences for several job outcomes, little is known about the factors that can mitigate such relationships—particularly the relationship between emotional exhaustion and ethical behavior. To remedy this knowledge gap, we draw from self-control theory to propose a novel theoretical framework and develop hypotheses. These hypotheses are tested on a unique dataset consisting of survey data collected from 123 matched business-to-business (B2B) salesperson–manager dyads. The findings reveal that (1) emotional exhaustion is negatively associated with sales performance, (2) emotional exhaustion is negatively associated with ethical behaviors, (3) ethical behaviors are positively associated with sales performance, (4) ethical behaviors mediate emotional exhaustion’s negative effect on sales performance, (5) perceived supervisor support attenuates the negative association between emotional exhaustion and ethical behaviors, and (6) contrary to expectations, grit strengthens the negative association between emotional exhaustion and ethical behaviors. As we show here, perceived supervisor support may attenuate the undesirable effects of emotional exhaustion on ethical behaviors and sales performance. The article’s broader contribution thus lies in its suggestion that managers pay special attention to these factors.

Using an undergraduate student sample, this correlational study assessed the relationship between emotion regulation tendencies and performance in emotionally-relevant domains of leadership. Results provide partial support, suggesting that situation modification and cognitive reappraisal are positively related to leadership performance, whereas suppression was found to relate negatively with performance. Emotion regulation strategies were also found to account for variance in leadership performance above and beyond other emotion-related individual differences. Taken together, these findings suggest that certain regulation processes may be more functional for leaders and extend emotion regulation research in the leadership domain.

Research consistently demonstrates that the value or harm of gaming on wellbeing cannot be determined solely from whether and how much people play, but rather depends on contingent factors related to the player, the game, and the gaming context. In this paper, we aim to model contingent factors that differentiate between beneficial and harmful outcomes within players of the same massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG). We model how passion for gaming—defined as a strong desire to engage in a beloved activity that is enjoyed and valued, in which time and energy is invested, and that ultimately integrates into a person's identity—affects loneliness and wellbeing. We employ the dualistic model that divides passion into harmonious passion (HP)—characterized by a balanced and authentic relationship with the beloved activity, and obsessive passion (OP)—characterized by preoccupation and inflexible persistence toward the loved activity. We sampled 300 frequent World of Warcraft (WoW) players, recruited from online forums, and used structural equation modeling (SEM) to investigate the effects of their passion for playing WoW on in-game social capital, loneliness, and wellbeing. We demonstrate that HP for playing WoW facilitates in-game social capital (both bridging and bonding), combats loneliness, and increases wellbeing, whereas OP also builds social capital, but these social ties do not combat loneliness, and OP is directly associated with increased loneliness. Further, the positive effect of HP on wellbeing is mediated through an increase in bonding social capital and a resulting decrease in loneliness. Our findings highlight that passion orientation is important for characterizing the relationship between gaming and wellbeing. We contribute to the conversation on combating problematic gaming, while also promoting digital gaming as an appealing leisure activity that provides enjoyment, recovery, and meaningful social interaction for the millions of gamers who benefit from its captivation.",2020,10/21/22 1:35,10/21/22 1:35,10/21/22 1:35,,,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers,,,,"/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/UGVKFNHF/Mandryk et al_2020_How Passion for Playing World of Warcraft Predicts In-Game Social Capital,.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, questions arise regarding applicant reactions and behavior when algorithms automatically evaluate applicants' interview responses. This study tests arguments from previous research suggesting that applicants whose interviews will be automatically evaluated may use less impression management (IM), but could react more negatively to the interview. Design/methodology/approach Participants (N = 124; primarily German students) took part in an online mock interview where they responded to interview questions via voice recordings (i.e. an asynchronous interview). Prior to the interview, half of them were informed that their answers would be evaluated automatically (vs by a human rater). After the interviews, participants reported their honest and deceptive IM behavior as well as their reactions to the interview. Findings Participants in the automatic evaluation condition engaged in less deceptive IM, felt they had fewer opportunities to perform during the interview, and provided shorter interview answers. Research limitations/implications The findings of this study suggest a trade-off between IM behavior and applicant reactions in technologically advanced interviews. Furthermore, the results indicate that automatically evaluated interviews might affect interview validity (e.g. because of less deceptive IM) and influence interviewees' response behavior. Practical implications Hiring managers might hope that automatically evaluated interviews decrease applicants' use of deceptive IM.

We contend that when customers mistreat employees (i.e., customer mistreatment), employees experience intuitive emotional reactions in the form of hostility, which automatically activates devaluation of targets, a specific facet of moral disengagement. In turn, employees become unencumbered by moral self-regulation and sabotage customers who mistreat them (i.e., customer-directed sabotage). We further argue that our serially mediated model is moderated by employees’ perceptions of the organization’s ethical climate. When ethical climates are perceived as being low, employees’ hostile reactions toward misbehaving customers produce a positive relationship with devaluation of targets, and devaluation of targets results in a positive relationship with customer-directed sabotage. These positive relationships do not hold when ethical climate is perceived as being high. We test our theoretical model using a field sample of customer service employees and an experimental study to establish causality. Our results provide general support for our hypotheses.

Little is known about psychological risk factors that affect the association between stress and dermatological conditions. One relevant factor that may modulate this link is anxiety sensitivity (AS) social concerns – the propensity to respond fearfully to anxiety-related sensations (e.g. sweating, flushing) owing to perceived social consequences (e.g. rejection or humiliation). Objectives To gain insight into psychological factors affecting skin disease, we examined the moderating role of AS social concerns in the relationship between stress and skin disease quality of life (QoL). Methods Participants [n = 237 (161 female), mean ± SD age 34·18 ± 9·57 years] with active skin disease symptoms were recruited online and completed questionnaires assessing stress, AS social concerns, skin disease QoL and global skin disease symptom severity. Results AS social concerns moderated the association between stress and skin-related emotional and social functioning in adults with skin disease.

Whilst automatic behaviours are triggered by context and do not serve a particular purpose or goal, routines often have purpose, and because they have been performed so often in a given context, they become automatic only after their action sequence has been activated.

Compulsive personality is associated with an increase in both aspects of habitual tendency, whereas impulsivity is linked with increased automaticity, but reduced routine behaviours.

This has occurred in part because of a lack of standardized assessment tools developed with the specific intent of studying dimensional classification. The goal of the current study was to develop and validate the Multidimensional Emotional Disorder Inventory (MEDI) to efficiently assess nine empirically supported transdiagnostic dimensions proposed in the Brown and Barlow (2009) profile approach to emotional disorder classification: neurotic temperament, positive temperament, depression, autonomic arousal, somatic anxiety, social anxiety, intrusive cognitions, traumatic reexperiencing, and avoidance. The MEDI factor structure, reliability, and convergent/discriminant validity was evaluated in outpatients with emotional disorders (pilot sample = 227; validation sample = 780). The final 9-factor solution fit the data well. Intercorrelations among MEDI factors were consistent with previous research, and all MEDI dimensions had acceptable reliability. Correlations with common self-report questionnaires and DSM–5 diagnoses supported the convergent/discriminant validity of all nine MEDI dimensions. Collectively, these results support the use of 49-item MEDI in clinical research samples. The MEDI should be used in future research to evaluate the validity of the Brown and Barlow (2009) approach to emotional disorder classification. Because it provides an efficient assessment of several well-established emotional disorder traits and phenotypes, the MEDI also may have utility for general research or clinical purposes.

Social–cognitive theory emphasizes the positive influence that perceiving higher performers can have on observer task and job performance (because observational learning from role models enhances self-efficacy). Social comparison theory emphasizes the negative self-evaluations that accompany perceiving higher performers, which should under many circumstances reduce self-efficacy and subsequent task and job performance. To more fully understand the effects of perceiving higher performance, we argue the effects of perceived higher performers on observer task and job performance depend on individuals’ disposition in how they cognitively process coworkers’ performance. Drawing on goal orientation theory, we suggest individuals with higher levels of performance prove goal orientation (PPGO) primarily interpret perceived higher performers as comparative referents rather than as instructive role models, inhibiting social learning and reducing self-efficacy. Results from a 2 studies (a field study of 110 corporate employees as well as an experimental study with 107 undergraduate students) support these ideas: Individuals with higher levels of PPGO have decreased self-efficacy and performance when observing higher performing coworkers, and individuals with lower levels of PPGO have increased self-efficacy and performance when observing higher performing coworkers.

Although scholars have suggested that side-hustles conflict with full-time work performance, we assert that psychological empowerment from side-hustles enriches full-time work performance. We argue that side-hustle complexity—the motivating characteristics of side-hustles—positively relates to empowerment and that side-hustle motives moderate this relationship. A study of 337 employees supports these assertions. We then investigate the spillover of side-hustle empowerment to full-time work performance in a 10-day experience-sampling method study of 80 employee–coworker dyads. We address an affective pathway in which daily side-hustle empowerment enriches full-time work performance through side-hustle engagement and positive affect at work. We also consider a cognitive pathway wherein side-hustle empowerment distracts from full-time work performance through side-hustle engagement and attention residue—persistent cognitions about side-hustles during full-time work. Overall, performance enrichment from side-hustles was stronger than performance conflict. We also consider affective shift from full-time work to side-hustles, finding negative affect from full-time work strengthens the relationship between side-hustle empowerment and engagement.

In a systematic analysis of psychometric properties, the RFSS’ factorial structure, reliability, and associations with theoretically related constructs were examined. As expected, the RFSS showed a two-factor structure, positive correlations with variables related to reading pleasure and flow, and an inverted U-shaped association with perceived fit between reader skills and text challenge. Comparisons of confirmatory factor analysis model confirmed that RFSS items loaded on different latent variables than items assessing other narrative engagement concepts, namely presence, identification, suspense, and cognitive mastery, and hence distinctly capture flow states in fiction reading.

Existing evidence suggests that the Big Five domains account for only a small amount of variance in religiosity. Some researchers have claimed that the Big Five domains are too broad and not sufficiently specific to explain much religiosity variance. Accordingly, they speculated that the more specific Big Five facets should predict religiosity better. Yet, such research has generally been sparse, monocultural, descriptive, process-inattentive, and somewhat contradictory in its results. Therefore, we conducted three large-scale, cross-cultural, theory-driven, and process-attentive studies. Study 1 (N = 2,277,240) used self-reports across 96 countries, Study 2 (N = 555,235) used informant-reports across 57 countries, and Study 3 (N = 1,413,982) used self-reports across 2,176 cities, 279 states, and 29 countries. Our results were highly consistent across studies. Contrary to widespread assumptions, the Big Five facets did not explain substantially more variance in religiosity than the Big Five domains. Moreover, culture was much more important than previously assumed. More specifically, the Big Five facets collectively explained little variance in religiosity in the least religious cultural contexts (4.2%) but explained substantial variance in religiosity in the most religious cultural contexts (19.5%). In conclusion, the Big Five facets are major predictors of religiosity, but only in religious cultural contexts.

A vignette study with 143 purchasing managers and 137 business-to-business sales managers tests the developed hypotheses.

Our aim is to contribute further to this literature by examining how the use of the carbon copy (cc) function in email communication influences felt trust. We develop the argument that the use of cc enhances transparency—representing an important characteristic of workplace ethics—and hence promotes trust. We further argue that a downside of the cc option may be that it can also be experienced as a control mechanism, which may therefore negatively affect trust. The results of our first study showed that the use of cc indeed enhances perceived transparency, but at the same time also leads to the experience of increased control. Building upon this insight, the findings of five subsequent studies consistently revealed that the use of cc negatively influences felt trust. More precisely, employees felt trusted the least when the supervisor was always included in cc (Studies 2 and 3). This effect on felt trust also negatively influenced how trustworthy the organizational climate was perceived (Study 4).

In one of the flagships of mass collaboration—Wikipedia—a large number of authors socially negotiate the world’s largest compendium of knowledge. Several guidelines in Wikipedia restrict contributions to verifiable information from reliable sources to ensure recognized knowledge. Much psychological research demonstrates, however, that individual information processing is biased. This poses the question whether individual biases translate to Wikipedia articles or whether they are prevented by its guidelines. The present research makes use of hindsight bias to examine this question. To this end, we analyzed foresight and hindsight versions of Wikipedia articles regarding a broad variety of events (Study 1). We found the majority of articles not to contain traces of hindsight bias—contrary to prior individual research. However, for a particular category of events—disasters—we found robust evidence for hindsight bias. In a lab experiment (Study 2), we then examined whether individuals’ hindsight bias is translated into articles under controlled conditions and tested whether collaborative writing—as present in Wikipedia—affects the resultant bias (vs. individual writing). Finally, we investigated the impact of biased Wikipedia articles on readers (Study 3). As predicted, biased articles elicited a hindsight bias in readers, who had not known of the event previously. Moreover, biased articles also affected individuals who knew about the event already, and who had already developed a hindsight bias: biased articles further increased their hindsight.",9/1/18,10/21/22 1:42,10/21/22 1:42,10/21/22 1:42,1010-1026,,5,82,,Psychological Research,Biases in the production and reception of collective knowledge,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based upon a contemporary understanding of stress and a set of stressors that is a substantial update to existing scales, the Digital Stressors Scale (DSS) advances the measurement of digital stress. Initially, 138 items were constructed for the instrument and grouped into a set of 15 digital stressors. Based on a sample of N = 1,998 online questionnaires completed by individuals representative of the US employed population, the scale was refined using exploratory factor analyses (EFA) and PLS-SEM. The resulting and final scale consists of ten stressor categories reflective of one higher-order construct and a total of 50 items. Through a nomological network that includes important outcome variables of digital stress (emotional exhaustion, innovation climate, job satisfaction, user satisfaction) it was then demonstrated that the DSS provides substantial explanatory power, particularly related to emotional exhaustion and user satisfaction. Thus, the DSS constitutes a state-of-the-art self-report instrument to measure the extent of distress appraisal related to digital technologies in the workplace and helps to explain further how and why information and communication technologies can lead to adverse outcomes in individuals, thereby providing the starting point for job related organizational interventions.",2021,10/21/22 1:43,10/21/22 1:43,10/21/22 1:43,,,,12,,,The Digital Stressors Scale,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/LFUGIUR5/Fischer et al_2021_The Digital Stressors Scale.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, despite a wide-ranging consensus that negative affect (NA) is a precursor to CWB, there is surprisingly little consensus as to whether CWB enactment will subsequently lead to lower or higher levels of NA. That is, scholars disagree as to whether CWB has a reparative (negative) or generative (positive) effect on subsequent NA. We submit that both perspectives have validity, and thus the question should not be whether CWB is associated with lower or higher subsequent levels of NA, but rather for whom. This article is dedicated to answering this question. Drawing from the behavioral concordance model, we position empathy as a moderator of this relationship, such that CWB will be reparative for those with lower levels of empathy and generative for those with higher levels of empathy.

In this context, this study was designed to explore the effects of a one-day female-focused STEM-based entrepreneurship program (for brevity, we call it the OzGirlsEntrepreneurship program) on the entrepreneurial intention of secondary school female students. The study collected data from two surveys completed by 193 secondary school female students, aged 14–16 years, who participated in the OzGirlsEntrepreneurship program. This program encouraged girls to develop and implement creative computational solutions to socially relevant problems, with an Internet of Things (IoT) component using the micro:bit device. The findings reveal that a key factor in the development of entrepreneurial attitudes in young female students is associated with soft-skills development, particularly in the areas of creative thinking, risk-taking, problem-solving, and leadership development. The importance of meaningful human connections, including positive role modelling and peer to peer learning were also important factors in fostering entrepreneurial intent.

Integrating ambivalent sexism theory, resource management theories of career success, and social role theory, we theorize differential mechanisms via which hostile and benevolent sexism are divergently related to objective and subjective career success. Results revealed that gender had direct relationships with hostile sexism, whereas gender tended to also moderate relationships between benevolent sexism and choices and experiences at the work-family interface that could be prescribed by traditional gender roles (i.e., length of career interruptions and work-to-family conflict). Additionally, actions and choices that were more visible to others generally mediated relationships between sexist attitudes and objective career success (i.e., hostile sexism → seeking career advice from men → pay), whereas internal experiences and cognitions tended to mediate relationships between sexist attitudes and subjective career success (i.e., benevolent sexism → work-family conflict → satisfaction, but only for women).

Guided by an integrated review of the religion literature, we specify three dimensions of gender differentiation—social domains, sexuality, and agency—that explain why religiosity widens the gender wage gap. A series of studies tested our theoretical model. Two studies showcased the predictive power of religiosity on the gender wage gap across 140 countries worldwide and the 50 United States via gender-differentiated social domains, sexuality, and agency, explaining 37% of the variance in the wage gap.

Consequently, there is confusion and inconsistency regarding the measurement and application of resilience. To promote clarity, the authors conduct an examination of resilience measurement approaches. This was accomplished by elaborating on three fundamentally distinct conceptualizations of resilience that can serve as an organizing framework for measurement; (1) attribute/resource-focused; (2) process-focused; and (3) outcome-focused. To verify the utility of this framework, qualified and trained subject matter experts (SMEs) completed a content analysis categorization task by sorting 227 items from 11 scales into these categories. Frame-of-reference (FOR) training was used to prepare the SMEs. Results were largely supportive of the three category framework, as overall SME agreement was 86.76 percent and only 10 of 227 items (4.41%) were categorized as “unclear” with regard to the categories. At the same time, SME agreement varied across the scales and sub-dimensions examined, suggesting that some scales/sub-dimensions are more conceptually clear than others in terms of the three categories.

Across four studies, we find that heterosexual employees are more threatened by gay and lesbian disclosure that is in opposition to heterosexual norms than disclosure that resonates with heterosexual norms and this threat explains the extent to which they derogate or embrace the gay and lesbian identity. Further, heterosexual employees’ identity commitment buffers their experiences of threat and attenuates the impact of threat on derogating and embracing responses.

The study examines whether advertising strategies which use female-disparaging themes are perceived as ethical, and what effect this has on ad and brand attitudes. It also examines whether or not humour assuages ethical evaluations of female-disparaging ads. The findings from an experimental research design, which included 336 British respondents, show that non-disparaging and non-humorous ads are considered to be the most ethical, while disparaging ads (regardless of the level of humour) are considered the least ethical. Across the board, female-disparaging ads are not perceived as ethical; however, high benevolent sexists appear to favour them most. Finally, an ad’s perceived ethicality mediates the relationship between ad disparagement and ad attitudes; likewise, an ad’s perceived ethicality and ad attitudes mediate the relationship between an ad’s female disparagement and brand attitudes. Female-disparaging ads should be avoided given that they are perceived as less ethical and given the impact that advertising has on behaviour, as well as on societal and moral values.

Despite this increasing popularity, little is known about how theory-driven game-based assessments (GBA), those designed to reflect a targeted construct, should be designed, or their potential for achieving their simultaneous goals of positive reactions and high-quality psychometric measurement. In the present research, we develop a theory of GBA design by integrating game design and development theory from human–computer interaction with psychometric theory. Next, we test measurement characteristics, prediction of performance, fairness, and reactions of a GBA designed according to this theory to measure latent general intelligence (g). Using an academic sample with GPA data (N = 633), we demonstrate convergence between latent GBA performance and g (β = .97). Adding an organizational sample with supervisory ratings of job performance (N = 49), we show GBA prediction of both GPA (r = .16) and supervisory ratings (r = .29). We also show incremental prediction of GPA using unit-weighted composites of the g test battery beyond that of the g-GBA battery but not the reverse. We also show the presence of similar adverse impact for both the traditional test battery and GBA but the absence of differential prediction of criteria. Reactions were more positive across all measures for the g-GBA compared to the traditional test battery. Overall, results support GBA design theory as a promising foundation from which to build high-quality theory-driven GBAs.

Drawing from the theory of self-conscious emotions and moral psychology, we propose that leniency elicits feelings of pride that enhance engagement and also elicits feelings of guilt that enhance exhaustion. Taken together, we propose that leniency indirectly influences energy states through self-conscious emotions. A multistudy approach was utilized to test these predictions. The results from Study 1 (a multiwave field study of police officers in the United States) and Study 2 (an experiment) largely supported our predictions.

The background of the study is the argument that it requires active social sense-making and behavioral adaptability to advance in organizations. The present paper thus explores the extent to which employees’ paranoid cognitions—representative of a heightened albeit suspicious sense-making and behavioral adaptability—link with their advancement in organizations (operationalized as changes in afforded span of control), both as an antecedent and an outcome. Following the strategy to illuminate the process by interaction analysis, both conditions (antecedent and outcome) are examined in interaction with employees’ self-monitoring, which is considered representative of a heightened but healthy sense-making and behavioral adaptability. Results support the expected interference interaction between paranoid cognitions and self-monitoring in that each can to some degree compensate for the other in explaining employees’ organizational advancement. Reversely, changes in span of control also affected paranoid cognitions. In particular, low self-monitors, i.e., those low in adaptive sense-making, reacted with heightened paranoid cognitions when demoted. In effect, the present study is thus the first to empirically support that paranoid cognitions can be a consequence but also a prerequisite for getting ahead in organizations. Practical advice should, however, be suspended until it is better understood whether and under what circumstances paranoia may relate not only to personally getting ahead but also to an increased effectiveness for the benefit of the organization.",2016,10/21/22 1:53,10/21/22 1:53,10/21/22 1:53,,,,7,,,Paranoia as an Antecedent and Consequence of Getting Ahead in Organizations,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/TUEE77A2/Van Quaquebeke_2016_Paranoia as an Antecedent and Consequence of Getting Ahead in Organizations.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability of the method to eliminate SDR stems from matching items that are perceived as equally desirable into forced-choice item-blocks. The gold standard in quantifying similarity between items in terms of desirability has been the “mean difference index”, that is, the absolute difference between items' mean desirability ratings. This index relies on the assumption that items have one true desirability value, as efficiently and unbiasedly estimated by their respective means, and may fail if this assumption does not hold. To circumvent this issue, we propose indexing similarity between items in terms of desirability with several robust measures of absolute agreement (i.e., inter-item agreement indices). Using an empirical example, we show that relying on the mean difference index may lead to suboptimal forced-choice item-block assembly by matching items with a relatively poor inter-item agreement with respect to desirability. R code for computing the proposed agreement indices on a set of desirability ratings is provided, as are recommendations for applied researchers.",12/1/21,10/21/22 1:53,10/21/22 1:53,10/21/22 1:53,111114,,,183,,Personality and Individual Differences,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/T7N584WR/Pavlov et al_2021_Item desirability matching in forced-choice test construction.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/4W6ZNH22/S0191886921004931.html,,,Faking; Socially desirable responding; Forced-choice; Desirability matching; Inter-item agreement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study sought to assess the psychometric properties of the original Cooperative Classroom Environment Measure (CCEM) and refine the measure to increase its validity for use in the classroom. The CCEM was developed to provide information to educators about factors in the classroom environment contributing to student prosociality. The original form was answered by 431 undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory life science class. Following data collection, both exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and Rasch analysis were used to remove problematic items and generate a refined form. The psychometric properties of this refined form were examined using Rasch and confirmatory factor analysis, and supported the presence of six (out of eight originally hypothesized) subscale constructs analogous to those influencing prosociality in other contexts. Additional evidence showed the presence of a single prominent underlying latent factor (termed Prosocial) that could account for significant variance in all subscale constructs. These findings provided preliminary evidence for the use of both the CCEM subscales and whole survey measures for investigations into optimizing classroom social environments for prosocial action.",4/1/18,10/21/22 1:53,10/21/22 1:53,10/21/22 1:53,677-697,,4,16,,Int J of Sci and Math Educ,The Cooperative Classroom Environment Measure (CCEM),,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/EQIQ6P42/Premo et al_2018_The Cooperative Classroom Environment Measure (CCEM).pdf,,,Cooperation; Classroom assessment; Prosocial; Undergraduate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditional and ubiquitous response formats such as Likert and visual analogue scales require condensation of responses into discrete or point values—but sometimes a range of options may better represent the correct answer. In this paper, we propose an efficient interval-valued response mode, whereby responses are made by marking an ellipse along a continuous scale. We discuss its potential to capture and quantify valuable information that would be lost using conventional approaches, while preserving a high degree of response efficiency. The information captured by the response interval may represent a possible response range—i.e., a conjunctive set, such as the real numbers between 3 and 6. Alternatively, it may reflect uncertainty in respect to a distinct response—i.e., a disjunctive set, such as a confidence interval. We then report a validation study, utilizing our recently introduced open-source software (DECSYS), to explore how interval-valued survey responses reflect experimental manipulations of several factors hypothesised to influence interval width, across multiple contexts. Results consistently indicate that respondents used interval widths effectively, and subjective participant feedback was also positive. We present this as initial empirical evidence for the efficacy and value of interval-valued response capture. Interestingly, our results also provide insight into respondents’ reasoning about the different aforementioned types of intervals—we replicate a tendency towards overconfidence for those representing epistemic uncertainty (i.e., disjunctive sets), but find intervals representing inherent range (i.e., conjunctive sets) to be well-calibrated.",6/1/22,10/21/22 1:53,10/21/22 1:53,10/21/22 1:53,1240-1262,,3,54,,Behav Res,Capturing richer information,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/NFQCJHFF/Ellerby et al_2022_Capturing richer information.pdf,,,Ambiguity; Conjunctive; Disjunctive; Ellipse; Interval; Questionnaire; Sets; Software; Survey; Uncertainty; Vagueness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One common solution to this problem is to identify noneffortful responses and treat them as missing during parameter estimation via the effort-moderated item response theory (EM-IRT) model. Although this model has been shown to outperform traditional IRT models (e.g., two-parameter logistic [2PL]) in parameter estimation under simulated conditions, prior research has failed to examine its performance under violations to the model?s assumptions. Therefore, the objective of this simulation study was to examine item and mean ability parameter recovery when violating the assumptions that noneffortful responding occurs randomly (Assumption 1) and is unrelated to the underlying ability of examinees (Assumption 2). Results demonstrated that, across conditions, the EM-IRT model provided robust item parameter estimates to violations of Assumption 1. However, bias values greater than 0.20 SDs were observed for the EM-IRT model when violating Assumption 2; nonetheless, these values were still lower than the 2PL model. In terms of mean ability estimates, model results indicated equal performance between the EM-IRT and 2PL models across conditions. Across both models, mean ability estimates were found to be biased by more than 0.25 SDs when violating Assumption 2. However, our accompanying empirical study suggested that this biasing occurred under extreme conditions that may not be present in some operational settings. Overall, these results suggest that the EM-IRT model provides superior item and equal mean ability parameter estimates in the presence of model violations under realistic conditions when compared with the 2PL model.",6/1/21,10/21/22 1:54,10/21/22 1:54,10/21/22 1:54,569-594,,3,81,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,SAGE Journals,,Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/PRUNE6Y8/Rios_Soland_2021_Parameter Estimation Accuracy of the Effort-Moderated Item Response Theory.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How risk-taking shapes dominance, prestige, and leadership endorsement",Journal of Applied Psychology,,1939-1854,10.1037/apl0000868,,"Risk-taking can fuel innovation and growth, but it can also have devastating consequences for individuals and organizations. Here we examine whether risk-taking affords social-hierarchical benefits to risk-takers. Specifically, we investigate how risk-taking influences perceived dominance, prestige, and the willingness to endorse risk-takers’ leadership. Integrating insights from costly signaling theory and the dominance/prestige framework of social rank, we theorized that risk-taking increases leadership endorsement to the degree that it fuels perceptions of prestige, but decreases leadership endorsement to the degree that it fuels perceptions of dominance. However, we also hypothesized that risk-induced perceptions of dominance do translate into leadership endorsement in competitive (rather than cooperative) intergroup settings. We tested these hypotheses in four studies involving different samples, methods, and operationalizations. In Study 1, participants performed an implicit association test (IAT) that revealed that people associate risk with leader positions, and safety with follower positions. Study 2 was a longitudinal field survey conducted during the September 2019 Israeli elections, which showed that voters’ perceptions of politicians’ risk-taking propensities prior to the elections positively predicted perceived dominance and prestige as well as voting behavior during the elections. Finally, Studies 3 and 4 demonstrated that people are willing to support risk-takers as leaders in the context of competitive (as opposed to cooperative) intergroup situations, because perceived dominance positively predicts leadership endorsement in competitive (but not cooperative) intergroup settings. We discuss implications for understanding the social dynamics of organizational rank and the perpetuation of risky behavior in organizations, politics, and society at large.

To test these theoretical ideas, we developed and tested a leader role self-compassion intervention in two field experiments. In the first field experiment, we show that on days when leaders engage in leader role self-compassion, they help others more with both task-related and personal problems because they identify more strongly with their leader role. Consequently, on such days, stakeholders perceive these leaders as more competent and civil. In exploratory analyses, we also find that these effects are stronger for leaders with lower (vs. higher) structural power, suggesting that novice leaders may benefit more from leader role self-compassion.

Research has indicated associations between maladaptive personality traits and BPD. A separate line of work suggests that beliefs about how much one's anxiety can change (i.e., anxiety mindset) may influence a wide range of mental health symptoms, many of which people with BPD often exhibit. We begin to integrate these two perspectives in the current study by evaluating the relative effects of maladaptive personality traits and anxiety mindset on BPD symptoms in a large sample of undergraduates (N = 998). Results indicate that traits and mindsets are independent statistical predictors of BPD symptoms. These findings suggest that both maladaptive traits and anxiety mindset are relevant to BPD, which may inform future research on the connections between personality processes and BPD as well as clinical intervention.",2017-04,10/21/22 1:58,10/21/22 1:58,10/21/22 1:58,285-299,,4,36,,,,,,,,,,English,© 2017 Guilford Publications Inc.,,,,ProQuest,,"Num Pages: 285-299 Place: New York, United States Publisher: Guilford Press",,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/FBVQQMEX/Yalch et al_2017_Relative Effects of Maladaptive Traits and Anxiety Mindset on Borderline.pdf,,,DSM-5; borderline; mindset; personality disorders; traits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, state-of-the-art MML estimation procedures such as the Metropolis–Hastings Robbins–Monro (MH-RM) algorithm as well as approximate MML estimation procedures such as variational inference (VI) are computationally time-consuming when the sample size and the number of latent factors are very large. In this work, we investigate a deep learning-based VI algorithm for exploratory item factor analysis (IFA) that is computationally fast even in large data sets with many latent factors. The proposed approach applies a deep artificial neural network model called an importance-weighted autoencoder (IWAE) for exploratory IFA. The IWAE approximates the MML estimator using an importance sampling technique wherein increasing the number of importance-weighted (IW) samples drawn during fitting improves the approximation, typically at the cost of decreased computational efficiency. We provide a real data application that recovers results aligning with psychological theory across random starts. Via simulation studies, we show that the IWAE yields more accurate estimates as either the sample size or the number of IW samples increases (although factor correlation and intercepts estimates exhibit some bias) and obtains similar results to MH-RM in less time. Our simulations also suggest that the proposed approach performs similarly to and is potentially faster than constrained joint maximum likelihood estimation, a fast procedure that is consistent when the sample size and the number of items simultaneously tend to infinity.",3/1/21,10/21/22 1:58,10/21/22 1:58,10/21/22 1:58,29-Jan,,1,86,,Psychometrika,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/9Q7HDKKV/Urban_Bauer_2021_A Deep Learning Algorithm for High-Dimensional Exploratory Item Factor Analysis.pdf,,,Deep learning; item response theory; artificial neural network; categorical factor analysis; importance sampling; importance weighted autoencoder; latent variable modeling; variational autoencoder; variational inference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the number of studies that examined a specific resource focus was very small (k ≤ 5 in most cases), and most studies have left the focus of resource allocation decisions unspecified or referred to multiple foci simultaneously. Consequently, the extant literature provides a limited basis to draw strong conclusions regarding the comparability of distributive justice effects across resource foci.

Additionally, the pandemic also interfered with other life domains: closings of schools and companies, restricted access to public places, changes in work and home routines and increased uncertainty due to the economic repercussions. This study examines people’s experiences and mental health in the 6th consecutive lockdown week in Portugal and compares with the pre-confinement population’s mental health. Specifically, we explore the difficulties experienced by the general population while in lockdown, their strategies to cope with it, and its impact on mental health. One thousand five hundred and two participants undergoing the 6th lockdown week answered a web-based cross-sectional survey. Demographic information, living conditions, confinement-related difficulties or challenges, strategies to cope with lockdown and mental health dimensions were assessed. Some difficult confined related experiences and sociodemographic variables were associated with poor mental health. When compared to our findings, the general population’ mental health was better before the pandemic. Lockdown challenges experienced by participants and their strategies to cope with confinement predicted 10 to 42% of the variance in mental health dimensions. This study identified several mental health-protective and risk factors related to long-term compulsory confinement. Individual strategies to prevent mental health problems are discussed.

However, there has been little research on how paternity leaves impact men’s careers and the research that exists has been inconclusive. This is problematic because, while men are increasingly being encouraged to take paternity leaves, the fear may be that such leaves may undermine their careers. However, by integrating the literature on changing norms regarding effective leadership with expectancy violation theory, we suggest that taking a paternity leave can enhance others’ perceptions of men’s communality and lead to positive career outcomes. We tested our hypotheses in three studies in the context of Canadian parental leave policies. In a sample of undergraduate students (Study 1) and employees (Study 2) we found that increased communality perceptions underlie the positive effect of taking a paternity leave (vs. no paternity leave) on men’s reward recommendations and hireability ratings. In Study 3 we found evidence that the positive effect of paternity leaves on men’s career outcomes was stronger in a female-dominated industry (e.g., human resources) than in a male-dominated industry (finance).

With a field survey study of tipped employees who vary in financial dependence and emotional display requirements (Study 1), and an online experiment that manipulates financial dependence and emotional displays from the customer’s perspective (Study 2), our results confirm that these contextual factors jointly increase customer power and thus sexual harassment.

We propose that task interdependence misfit motivates a reductive form of job crafting, decreasing hindrance demands. We also propose that low autonomy mitigates the misfit to decreasing hindrance demands relationship. To empirically evaluate this direction, we employ moderated polynomial regression and response surface analysis.

SCYZ3VYT,journalArticle,2022,"Haehner, Peter; Kritzler, Sarah; Fassbender, Ina; Luhmann, Maike",Stability and change of perceived characteristics of major life events,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,,1939-1315,10.1037/pspp0000394,,"The occurrence of major life events is associated with changes in well-being and personality. To better understand these effects, it is important to consider how individuals perceive major life events. Although theories such as appraisal theory and affective adaptation theory suggest that event perceptions change over time and that these changes are relevant for personality and well-being, stability and change of perceived event characteristics have not been systematically examined. This article aims to fill this gap using data from a longitudinal study (N = 619 at T1). In this study, participants rated nine perceived characteristics of the same major life event up to five times within 1 year. We estimated rank-order and mean-level stabilities as well as intraclass correlations of these life event characteristics with continuous time models. Furthermore, we computed continuous time models for the stability of affective well-being and the Big Five personality traits to generate benchmarks for the interpretation of the stability of the life event characteristics. Rank-order stabilities for the life event characteristics were lower than for the Big Five, but higher than for affective well-being. Most of the variance in life event characteristics was explained by between-person differences. Furthermore, we found a significant mean-level increase for the life event characteristic change in world views and a significant decrease for extraordinariness. These mean-level changes are in line with the meaning-making literature and affective adaptation theory, whereas the rather high rank-order stability of the life event characteristics challenges the importance of reappraisal processes of major life events.

While some people hold the view that traits are fixed (entity theorists), others believe that they can be changed (incremental theorists). As these beliefs set up an interpretive framework for forming impressions and shaping attributions, they may affect victims’ responses to interpersonal transgressions. With two studies, we investigate how victims’ implicit theories of personality influence forgiveness following a transgression. Using an autobiographical narrative method, Study 1 (N = 82, college students) shows that having a fixed view of personality is associated with a lower willingness to forgive. In Study 2 (N = 181, adult workers), using a standardized hypothetical scenario of a transgression, we measure three motivations associated with forgiving: avoidance, revenge, and benevolence. Our results provide evidence that attributions of behavioral stability to the offender play a mediating role in the relationship between implicit theories and forgiveness. Having an incremental view of personality leads to lower attributions of behavioral stability to offenders. Such attributions in turn reduce victims’ motivations to avoid offenders and also improve positive feelings toward them. However, stability attributions do not decrease the victims’ desires to seek revenge against offenders.",4/15/20,10/21/22 1:59,10/21/22 1:59,10/21/22 1:59,109800,,,157,,Personality and Individual Differences,Can a leopard change its spots?,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/CDWUQ64Q/S0191886919307391.html,,,Mindsets; Forgiveness; Attributions of stability; Implicit theories of personality; Interpersonal transgressions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted two studies. An experimental team-level study of 54 teams (n = 157) and a survey study conducted among employees who work in teams (n = 141). Team-level analysis of study 1 reveals that CRF and team initiative mediate the effect of leadership and team members’ chronic regulatory focus on creative performance. In addition, collective promotion moderates the negative effects of collective prevention on both team initiative and creativity. Study 2 confirms the relationships between leadership styles, team CRF, and team initiative with employees at the individual level. Understanding the collective mechanisms that enable transformational leadership to foster team creativity contributes to the ability of organizations and managers to increase the creativity of team production by influencing team dynamics.

However, behavioural decision theory suggests that when choosing among job offers with different work–family benefits, individuals may fall prey to a decoy effect and this effect may be mediated through anticipated regret. This effect occurs when preferences are influenced by a normatively irrelevant decoy option that is clearly inferior to one of the other options in the choice set, but not the other (i.e., ‘asymmetrically dominated’). Across two studies, we investigated preferences for two important types of work–family benefits: flexible work arrangements (FWA) and dependent care support (DCS). We predicted and found a decoy effect: Preferences for jobs with these benefits were influenced by the presence of a normatively irrelevant decoy option. That is, preferences shifted towards either the FWA option or the DCS option depending on which option the decoy targeted (i.e., the option that asymmetrically dominated the decoy). The effects held over and above variables related to individuals’ work and family situations and values, including role centrality. Moreover, we found that anticipated regret mediated the effect of the decoy option on benefit preferences. Practitioner points Organizations can use decoy options with relatively inferior (i.e., dominated) job benefits as an implicit influence tactic to influence applicants' job preferences. Using this approach is only legitimate if it has a factual basis and recruiters need to take ethical aspects of such practices into consideration. Individuals need to be aware that when normatively irrelevant cues such as decoy options affect their decision-making process, their choices may be biased. By noticing decoy options and influence attempts of recruiters, individuals can ensure that their choices reflect their values, not contextual factors.",2018,10/21/22 1:59,10/21/22 1:59,10/21/22 1:59,441-464,,3,91,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/joop.12207,,"/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/E2CNEJAI/Reb et al_2018_Decoy effect, anticipated regret, and preferences for work–family benefits.pdf; /Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/BX32F572/joop.html",,,anticipated regret; decoy effect; role centrality; work–family benefits; work–family decisions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sample consisted of newcomers (N = 175) measured at two time points. Findings The results support the proposed model. Relational learning mediates the associations between social capital resources and outcomes; the utility of these social capital resources is stronger when job autonomy is lower. Practical implications Organizations can use social capital resources to reduce newcomers' uncertainty during socialization, facilitating learning and positive outcomes. Organizations should also carefully consider the amount of job autonomy they grant to newcomers, as too much can be detrimental. Originality/value Despite the acknowledged importance of workplace resources and relationships, few studies have focused on social resources provided during socialization.

Lastly, we explore the moderating role of post-misconduct state moral disengagement in shaping the effects of trait moral disengagement. Across three studies, we find that trait moral disengagement is positively linked to guilt following interpersonal deviance, unethical work behavior, and objective cheating behavior. Further, trait moral disengagement is indirectly, positively linked to emotional exhaustion, and negatively related to executive function (specifically, the capacity to inhibit distraction during tasks). In a fourth study, we find that trait moral disengagement is positively associated with guilt and subsequent emotional exhaustion when individuals employ little to no state moral disengagement immediately post-misconduct.

Valid and reliable assessment of vulnerability factors is essential for individualized treatment and improving clinical outcomes. Limited research has examined the factor structure of the predominantly used self-report measure of RS, the Adult Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire (A-RSQ; Berenson et al., 2009). Across two studies (Study 1: N = 346, 57.2% female, 76.6% White; 16.8% Hispanic/Latinx; Study 2: N = 540; 43.7% female, 80.2% White; 16.7% Hispanic/Latinx), we examined the factor structure of the A-RSQ in samples of adult U.S. residents and investigated associations with mental health correlates, including neuroticism, social anxiety, anxiety, depression, anhedonia, somatic arousal, and psychological distress. Study 2 also evaluated relations with interpersonal correlates, including introversion, submissiveness, and anxious and avoidant attachment. A two-factor solution with rejection expectancy and rejection concern representing separate factors consistently fit the data best. Distinct patterns of associations emerged suggesting that concern was more strongly associated with indicators of negative affect while expectancy was uniquely associated with diminished positive affect. Both concern and expectancy were associated with indicators of interpersonal dysfunction. Findings suggest that the current operationalization, and perhaps conceptualization, of RS as measured by the A-RSQ requires revision. Additionally, RS may be a clinically relevant transdiagnostic phenotype that influences symptom manifestation and psychosocial functioning.

In this article, we developed a novel model for examining the antecedents and consequences of perceived firm innovativeness. We argue that when customers cognitively register changes in the value creation introduced by a firm, they perceive the firm as more innovative and, consequently, more attractive than its competitors. Using two waves of data from nationally representative samples (1,293 and 1,583 responses), we developed measures for examining changes in value creation that firms introduce and customers can perceive. We tested our theory by applying structural equation modeling to data from a nationally representative sample (5,812 responses). We found that firms that introduced changes affecting value proposition, value actualization, and interaction space were perceived as more innovative and more attractive than their competitors. Surprisingly, changes in relationship experience are negatively associated with perceived innovativeness and contribute to lower relative attractiveness in the market.

University students were randomly assigned to the well-being toolkit intervention (n = 39), or one of two active control conditions that involved cognitive activity exercises (breathing and memory recall exercises) found to be ineffective in promoting well-being over and above intervention conditions in past research. The well-being toolkit control (n = 41) was presented to participants as an ostensible “Mental Wellbeing Toolkit” to increase expectancy beliefs. The cognitive toolkit control (n = 39) included the same cognitive activity exercises as the well-being toolkit control, but was presented to participants as a neutral “Cognitive Activity Toolkit.” Participants were instructed to complete 10 days of surveys and practice at least one exercise from their toolkit per day. Results from 1,133 data points showed declines across all conditions in stress and negative affect and increases in positive affect over 10 days. This finding points to a potential beneficial effect of intentionally engaging in activities involving some form of self-referential reflection—the underlying commonality across activities in all conditions—irrespective of whether individuals are instructed to engage in emotion regulation or not. However, compared with both control conditions, the intervention led to sharper growth in daily cognitive reappraisal over 10 days of practice, suggesting the intervention’s advantage of developing the foundational emotion regulation strategy of cognitive reappraisal.

Design/methodology/approach In this study structural equation modeling (SEM) and analysis of variances (ANOVAs) were used to test survey data collected at two points in time from 240 US doctors, nurses and allied health professionals. Findings The findings provide insight into why healthcare professionals, who undertake emotional labor, have a higher incidence of lower well-being and increased burnout rates compared with other jobs, except for emergency workers. The findings show that the relationship between PsyCap and well-being was different for low and high EC employees. The impact of PsyCap on well-being was greater for those with lower EC, and this means that those employees who have high EC have a greater risk of reduced well-being. Originality/value Traditional bureaucratic rationalist management models are inappropriate for managing those who have high EC and/or undertake emotional labor. Instead, new human resource (HR) models are needed that focus on employee well-being, and in providing greater organizational support and upskilling employees in how to cope with their emotions and to build their own reservoirs of personal support.",1/1/22,10/21/22 2:13,10/21/22 2:13,10/21/22 2:13,,,ahead-of-print,ahead-of-print,,,Catching emotions,,,,,,,,,,,,Emerald Insight,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/5E9LJ32K/Xerri et al_2022_Catching emotions.pdf,,,Employee well-being; Leader-member exchange; Emotional labor; Emotional contagion; Psychological capital,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We first provide evidence for the nature of the symbolic meanings associated with these three dimensions of work clothing in a set of within-person experimental studies. Then, the results of a 10-day field study of employees from four organizations generally supported our predictions, showing that daily clothing aesthetics and uniqueness had effects on state self-esteem and downstream behavioral consequences.

Given that these criteria lack strong methodological support, the objective of this simulation study was to evaluate their appropriateness in terms of individual ability estimate and classification accuracy when manipulating both assessment and RG characteristics. The findings provide evidence that employing a common criterion for all examinees may be an ineffective strategy because a given RG percentage may have differing degrees of biasing effects based on test difficulty, examinee ability, and RG pattern.

In this study, applying conservation of resources (COR) theory, we developed a moderated mediation model to investigate how engaging in servant leader behaviors impacts the actors themselves. We conducted a questionnaire survey at three large companies in China, and finally received valid responses from 479 employees who occupied leadership positions with an average age of 36.43 years old. We analyzed the collected data and tested the proposed hypotheses by using SPSS 25.0 and Mplus 8.3. The results revealed the possible benefits and costs of exhibiting servant leader behaviors for actors. Specifically, we found that engaging in servant leader behaviors can promote leaders’ psychological meaningfulness, thus aiding their work engagement. Besides, we also found that servant leader behaviors can lead to leaders’ increasing emotional exhaustion, thus lowering their work engagement. Furthermore, leaders experienced greater psychological meaningfulness and less emotional exhaustion when they received more support from their followers. This study provides insights into servant leadership literature by painting a complete picture about how servant leader behaviors impact the actor’s resources gain and loss. These findings suggest that organizations should not blindly exaggerate the positive impacts of servant leadership, but use a dialectic perspective to view its effects on the actors. In practice, despite encouraging leaders to display servant behaviors, organizations also should organize respite activities or encourage leaders to take little breaks at work in order to help them recover from depletion. Moreover, followers’ support for servant leaders also should be emphasized to replenish leaders’ depleted resources.",4/29/22,10/21/22 2:13,10/21/22 2:13,10/21/22 2:13,,,,,,Curr Psychol,A bittersweet experience,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/9HW9VXJV/Lan et al_2022_A bittersweet experience.pdf,,,Conservation of resources theory; Work engagement; Emotional exhaustion; Follower support; Psychological meaningfulness; Servant leader behaviors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To mitigate this potential bias, practitioners have relied on response time information to identify and filter RG responses. However, response times may be unavailable in many testing contexts, such as paper-and-pencil administrations. When this is the case, self-report measures of effort and person-fit statistics have been used. These methods are limited in that inferences concerning motivation and aberrant responding are made at the examinee level. As test takers can engage in a mixture of solution and RG behavior throughout a test administration, there is a need to limit the influence of potential aberrant responses at the item level. This can be done by employing robust estimation procedures. Since these estimators have received limited attention in the RG literature, the objective of this simulation study was to evaluate ability parameter estimation accuracy in the presence of RG by comparing maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to two robust variants, the bisquare and Huber estimators. Two RG conditions were manipulated, RG percentage (10%, 20%, and 40%) and pattern (difficulty-based and changing state). Contrasted to the MLE procedure, results demonstrated that both the bisquare and Huber estimators reduced bias in ability parameter estimates by as much as 94%. Given that the Huber estimator showed smaller standard deviations of error and performed equally as well as the bisquare approach under most conditions, it is recommended as a promising approach to mitigating bias from RG when response time information is unavailable.",5/1/22,10/21/22 2:14,10/21/22 2:14,10/21/22 2:14,236-249,,3,46,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,SAGE Journals,,Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/VM3IXZ6Z/Rios_2022_A Comparison of Robust Likelihood Estimators to Mitigate Bias From Rapid.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Study 1 examines these two processes and gamification’s downstream consequences on purchase intention and product information recognition. For purchase intention, the two processes operate in parallel and produce a null effect of gamification. For product information recognition, only the negative process emerges, resulting in a negative effect of gamification. Studies 2 and 3 focus on the negative effect of gamification on product information recognition and show that the negative effect disappears in gamification designs that link the game elements with meaningful information about the product (Study 2) or make consumers aware of the distraction potential of game elements (Study 3).

We further suggest that this effect is stronger for followers who are higher in institutional discrimination awareness (defined as those who are more likely to view racial/ethnic identities as consequential within society). Finally, we assert that this interactive effect on ethical leadership will subsequently influence follower engagement in discretionary, proactive behavior directed toward the organization.

Design/methodology/approach Semi-structured interviews, based on theoretical milestones of performance management and cognitive psychology, gathered from 104 experienced professionals’ evaluations on the likelihood and impact of managers’ cognitive biases in PMS implementation, potential solutions as well as drivers and connected criticalities. Findings Recurring cognitive biases, together with considerable impacts, emerged in the first, and most strategic, phases of the PMS implementation. The authors developed a roadmap to support corporate transition to integrate behavioral strategy into the PMS implementation aiming to achieve economically and efficiently sound performance. Research limitations/implications From the view of proper behavioral strategy affirmation in performance management literature, in a small way, the authors contribute to a desirable taxonomy of cognitive biases so differentiated decision-making scenarios may be built to compare results and draw new observations. Behavioral studies could transversally connect the cognitive biases of performance management to actors’ sociodemographic features and personality types. Practitioners may check biases affecting their organizations by means of the questionnaire and, consequently, adopt the framework illustrated to reduce them. Originality/value Performance management literature has constantly investigated positive and negative behavioral factors related to the PMS. This study, instead, makes a theoretical and methodological contribution to the PMS implementation as a decision-making process. The authors propose a theoretical framework that integrates cognitive psychology insights and applies measures to reduce biases.",1/1/22,10/21/22 2:14,10/21/22 2:14,10/21/22 2:14,1110-1136,,9,45,,,Cognitive biases in implementing a performance management system,,,,,,,,,,,,Emerald Insight,,Publisher: Emerald Publishing Limited,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/E3YDJF7H/Hristov et al_2022_Cognitive biases in implementing a performance management system.pdf,,,Organizational behavior; Behavioral strategy; Cognitive biases; Conceptual framework; Decision-making; Performance management system; Performance measurement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, this construct has received less attention compared to other unethical behaviors, and as such, the literature has only a rudimentary understanding of why employees engage in time theft. Thus, the primary goal of this research is to provide greater insight into both why employees engage in time theft and who is most likely to engage in time theft. To do so, we draw from social information processing theory to examine the effect of laissez-faire leadership on employee time theft. More specifically, we propose that laissez-faire leadership is related to employee time theft through workplace time theft norms. We further propose that this indirect effect is contingent on employee conscientiousness, such that the indirect effect of laissez-faire leadership on employee time theft is stronger for individuals lower in conscientiousness. We conducted two three-wave field studies to test our predictions. The results of Study 1 supported our prediction that workplace time theft norms mediate the effect of laissez-faire leadership on employee time theft.

(2010),Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,,1939-1315,10.1037/pspa0000304,,"Since humanity’s first steps, individuals have used nonverbal cues to communicate and infer leadership, such as walking ahead of others. Menon et al., (2010) showed that the use of spatial ordering as cue to leadership differs across cultures: Singaporeans were more likely than Americans to represent leaders behind rather than in front of groups. Furthermore, they showed that threat priming increases the representation of leaders at the back. We replicate and extend these findings. We draw on cultural tightness theory to explain variability in mental representations of leadership, advance the spatial precedence hypothesis that leaders are generally represented in the front, use a large cross-cultural sample to compare different cultural dimensions, and employ alternative operationalizations of threat. We show that leaders are generally represented in frontal spatial positions across 25 countries and in different types of teams. We also find that cultural tightness and ecological threat (pandemic, warfare, and predation) lead people to represent leaders at the back (Studies 1–5). Mediational models show that ecological threat triggers greater desire for tightness and norm-enforcing leaders, which in turn leads people to represent leaders at the back (Study 4). Likewise, in tightly regulated work-teams, leaders are thought of as being seated at the office’s back desk (Study 5). Thus, we converge with Menon et al. that different cultures have different mental representations of leaders and individuals who face threats show greater preference for leaders at the back. Additionally, we demonstrate that cultural tightness is the key cultural predictor of mental representations of leadership.

We theorize and find—across two studies centered upon various mega-threats, including a mass shooting targeting Asian Americans and police killings of Black civilians—that event observers who share identities with mega-threat victims become vicarious victims, which triggers an experience of “embodied threat,” an appraisal of the increased likelihood of personally encountering identity-based harm. The experience of embodied threat coupled with the racialized nature of organizational structures, which limits the agency of racial minorities, then compels employees to engage in threat suppression. Furthermore, we find that threat suppression consumes psychological resources, leading to heightened avoidant work behaviors, or higher work withdrawal and lower social engagement, but, when the psychological safety of identity-based discussions is high, it attenuates this effect. Altogether, our paper advances research on mega-threats and race in organizations, and yields practical insights that can assist managers in reducing the detrimental effects of mega-threats on employees.",2022-06,10/21/22 2:14,10/21/22 2:14,10/21/22 2:14,720-748,,3,65,,AMJ,“Am I Next?,,,,,,,,,,,,journals-aom-org.prox.lib.ncsu.edu (Atypon),,Publisher: Academy of Management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The growing schism between entrepreneurial action theory (EAT) on the one hand, and empirics and practice on the other hand, represents a consequential and exciting opportunity for the field to revisit its core assumptions regarding rationality, particularly the presence, role, and function of rational intentionality. In this study, we undertake a review and exploratory investigation of the assertion that without reasoned intentionality there is no entrepreneurship. Our work generates three important insights that contribute to rethinking key facets of the most prominent and influential EATs: alternative, non-rational pathways to business venturing exist with a non-ignorable prevalence; a proclivity towards reasoned intentionality is not invariably prescriptive; and, less-reasoned, less-deliberative tendencies do not constitute an entrepreneurial death sentence.

We posit that these relationships differ for two primary conceptualizations, balance satisfaction and effectiveness. We collect data using two samples, each with three time points. In Study 1 (N = 681), we test our hypotheses for balance satisfaction. Cross-lagged analyses indicated that bidirectional enrichment predicted subsequent job and family satisfaction, and in turn, balance satisfaction. Thus, enrichment appears to primarily initiate the balance satisfaction process as it unfolds over time. Contrary to common theoretical and practical assumptions, role satisfaction seems to drive balance satisfaction rather than the other way around. In Study 2 (N = 493), we test our hypotheses for balance satisfaction and balance effectiveness. Cross-lagged analyses indicated that conflict primarily initiated the balance effectiveness process where role performance and balance effectiveness operated in feedback cycles of mutual influence over time. Posthoc model tests are consistent with Study 1 in that work-to-family enrichment predicted job satisfaction and in turn, balance satisfaction. Collectively, these studies suggest that the processes involving balance satisfaction versus balance effectiveness have different primary originating factors (enrichment or conflict, respectfully) and different temporal sequencing with role satisfaction and performance (unidirectional vs. reciprocal, respectively), warranting distinct theoretical explanations. This program of research represents a comprehensive, theoretical explanation and temporal examination of work–family balance, setting the stage for a new phase of research.

Building on these hypotheses, we further theorize that the indirect effect of coworker presenteeism on OCBOs and OCBIs differ when employees are psychologically detached from their organization.

Although performance pressure produces beneficial outcomes, it can also encourage cheating behavior. However, removing performance pressure altogether to reduce cheating is not only impractical but also eliminates pressure’s benefits. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to test an intervention to counteract some of the most harmful effects of performance pressure. Specifically, I integrate the self-protection model of workplace cheating (Mitchell et al., 2018) with self-affirmation theory (Steele, 1988) to demonstrate the utility of a personal values affirmation intervention to short-circuit the direct and indirect effects of performance pressure on cheating through anger and self-serving cognitions. Two experiments were used to test these predictions. In a lab experiment, when people affirmed core personal values, the effect of performance pressure on cheating was neutralized; as was pressure’s direct effect on anger and indirect effect on cheating via anger. A field experiment replicated the intervention’s ability to mitigate performance pressure’s direct effect on anger and indirect effect on cheating through anger. Altogether, this work provides a useful approach for combating the harmful effects of performance pressure and offers several theoretical and practical implications.

The personality and social psychology literatures show forming impressions of what others are like is vitally important, in part, because it facilitates the forecasting and acceptance of others’ behavior. Interestingly, very few studies consider others’ (i.e., subordinates) judgments about their leaders’ personality and whether correspondence between leaders’ self-perceptions and these others’ judgments is capable of providing meaningful and unique information. Using a socioanalytic perspective that considers multiple stakeholders, this study explores the (in)congruence effects between leaders’ self-perception of narcissism (i.e., identity) and subordinates’ perceptions of their leaders’ narcissism (i.e., reputation) on two types of performance outcomes. Polynomial regression and response surface analysis indicate that congruence between leaders’ narcissism identity and subordinates’ aggregated ratings of leaders’ narcissistic reputation related to group task and contextual performance via shared justice perceptions and collective effort in Study 1. Results of Study 2, which focused on leader–subordinate dyads, found leaders’ narcissism identity–reputation congruence effects were related to individual subordinates’ task and contextual performance via the subordinate’s individual justice perceptions, but not by way of individual effort. These findings have important implications for leaders and organizations and suggest that to fully understand the implications of leaders’ narcissism, one should consider the perspectives of interacting parties and how they converge or diverge when investigating relationships with aspects of performance.

This paper argues that abusive supervision is considered to be a less typical leader behavior for female leaders, compared to male leaders, because abusive behaviors violate the stereotypes traditionally prescribed to female leaders (e.g., communal and caring). As such, drawing from gender stereotype theories (e.g., the lack-of-fit model and role congruity theory), we propose that, among leaders who engage in abusive supervision, employees will rate female leaders as less effective than male leaders. However, we also propose that employees will attribute female leaders' abuse to internal characteristics to a lesser extent than male leaders. Results from both an experimental study (Study 1) and a field study (Study 2) conducted with working adults support our hypotheses. Namely, results suggest that female leaders' abusive supervision is viewed as less typical leadership behavior and, consequently, is associated with lower ratings of effectiveness compared to abusive male leaders. Conversely, because abuse is viewed as female-atypical behavior, employees were less likely to make internal attributions for female leaders' abusive behaviors.

A field study with 317 customers of a large international supermarket chain in Lithuania demonstrates higher ratings of corporate reputation for customers receiving service from an employee with a hearing disability than for customers receiving service from an employee without disabilities.

This heterogeneity, when overlooked in data analysis, can lead to misspecified models and distorted inferences. While several methods exist to handle various forms of heterogeneity in latent variable models, their implementation in applied research requires additional layers of model crafting, which might be a reason for their underutilization. In response, we present a robust estimation approach based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Our method makes minor adjustments to EM to enable automatic detection of population heterogeneity and to recognize individuals who are inadequately explained by the assumed model. Each individual is associated with a probability that reflects how likely their data were to have been generated from the assumed model. The individual-level probabilities are simultaneously estimated and used to weight each individual’s contribution in parameter estimation. We examine the utility of our approach for Gaussian mixture models and linear factor models through several simulation studies, drawing contrasts with the EM algorithm. We demonstrate that our method yields inferences more robust to population heterogeneity or other model misspecifications than EM does. We hope that the proposed approach can be incorporated into the model-building process to improve population-level estimates and to shed light on subsets of the population that demand further attention.

The psychological processes and mechanisms that explain concrete behaviour in concrete situations should provide explanation for patterns of variation across situations and individuals, for development over time as well as for structures observed in intra?individual and inter?individual differences. Personality structures, defined as patterns of covariation in behaviour, including thoughts and feelings, are results of those processes in transaction with situational affordances and regularities. It cannot be presupposed that processes are organized in ways that directly correspond to the observed structure. Rather, it is an empirical question whether shared sets of processes are uniquely involved in shaping correlated behaviours, but not uncorrelated behaviours (what we term ?correspondence? throughout this paper), or whether more complex interactions of processes give rise to population?level patterns of covariation (termed ?emergence?).

Specifically, we examined the impact of high-performance human resource (HR) practices on employee engagement and work outcomes. Based on a sample of 605 employees, their immediate supervisors, and HR managers from 130 companies, our results indicated that high-performance HR practices were directly related to job engagement as well as indirectly related through employees' perceived organizational support. In turn, job engagement was positively related to in-role performance and negatively related to intent to quit. Culture was found to act as a critical contextual factor, as our results also revealed that the relationship between HR practices and perceived organizational support was stronger when collectivism was high and when power distance orientation was low. Overall, the findings shed new light on the processes and conditions through which employee work-related outcomes are enhanced owing to high-performance HR practices.

We further differentiate voice and silence by identifying their distinct effects on employee burnout.

Prior research has explained this puzzling phenomenon predominantly through an “actor-centric” perspective, proposing that managers’ just behavior is an outcome of their own individual differences. This paper shifts the locus of theorizing away from managers to their organizational context by arguing that managers’ adherence to principles of justice is often influenced by two key contextual features—workload and rewards. Drawing on the multiple-task pursuit framework, we propose that under high workloads, just treatment of employees often competes with other managerial tasks. We further argue that organizations implicitly and explicitly signal to managers that acting justly is not as important as their other technical tasks. Hence, managers who face high workloads (i.e., high amounts of work and time pressures) tend to prioritize other technical responsibilities at the expense of acting justly, unless explicitly rewarded otherwise. We find support for our theorizing across three studies (an experience sampling study, a field study, and an experiment).

We investigate this possibility by focusing on incivility appraisals—both negative and challenge appraisals (i.e. as an opportunity for learning, growth)—and their correlates. To explain this diversity of appraisals, we examine whether attributions (i.e. perceived intent to harm, perceived perpetrator control) predict perceptions. We conducted two multi-method (quantitative and qualitative) surveys, one of which was multi-source, of employees across a range of occupations. In Study 1, attributions that perpetrators acted with control and malicious intent fuelled negative appraisals of incivility, which undermined job satisfaction. Study 2 added to these findings by demonstrating that some targets formed challenge appraisals of uncivil encounters, especially when they attributed low malicious intent to perpetrators; challenge appraisal related to boosts in job satisfaction and thriving. These attitudinal outcomes then positively related to organisational citizenship behaviour, as reported by targets' coworkers.

However, research has not fully examined how managers, in the course of their jobs, can (a) identify and respond to justice-related issues and (b) assemble and synthesize relevant information required to act in a manner consistent with justice rules. To begin addressing these concerns, we posit feedback seeking as a key managerial behavior that can facilitate greater justice enactment because it promotes the flow of both solicited and unsolicited information from employees to managers. Such information flows enhance the saliency of fairness goals and allow managers to learn about employees' contextualized needs in ways that facilitate increased justice enactment. However, we argue that these effects are less likely to occur when feedback-seeking managers have lower generalized self-efficacy. An analysis of archival data (NManagers = 8,706, NEmployees = 40,830), a study with manager–employee dyads (N = 181), and a time-separated study of managers (N = 196) provide preliminary evidence in line with these arguments.

Here, we show how these two normative and distinctive P-O fits can be differentiated and related to an individual’s attitudes about their organization experience. Utilizing data from 723 participants from four samples, we show that the degree to which an individual’s description of their organizational culture corresponds to the normative ideal organizational culture may account for nearly all of the large associations regularly found between overall P-O fit indices and positive workplace attitudes. In contrast, the degree of fit between an individual’s work environment and their distinctive or idiosyncratic preferences may play a relatively small role in predicting the positive workplace attitudes.

Study 2 further examined these relationships among 263 undergraduate students using a scenario-based, experimental laboratory study. Findings In Study 1, counter to predictions, individuals who were higher in trait mindfulness were most likely to view an abusive supervisor as unfair. Exploratory analyses suggested that this effect was isolated to the mindfulness dimension of being highly attentive to moment-to-moment experiences. Study 2 replicated this effect with state mindfulness (specifically, attention to one’s present moment). Practical implications Organizations should consider how mindfulness interventions might not always be useful – and potentially counterproductive – for affecting perceptions of and reactions to some stressful work situations like abusive supervision. Originality/value Little research has been done on how mindfulness affects perceptions of and reactions to abusive supervisors. The authors expected mindfulness could reduce the negative effect of supervisor abuse on interactional justice perceptions, as well as the effect of interactional injustice on retaliation.

Based on recent findings that reveal personality traits predict as well as respond to life events and experiences, this research focuses on within-person change in contextualized extraversion and its predictive validity for cross-cultural adjustment in international students who newly arrived in US colleges. We proposed that the initial level as well as the rate of change in school extraversion (i.e., contextualized extraversion that reflects behavioral tendency in school settings) will predict cross-cultural adjustment, withdrawal cognitions, and school satisfaction. Latent growth modeling of three-wave longitudinal surveys of 215 new international students (54% female, Mage = 24 years) revealed that the initial level of school extraversion significantly predicted cross-cultural adjustment, (lower) withdrawal cognitions, and satisfaction, while the rate of change (increase) in school extraversion predicted cross-cultural adjustment and (lower) withdrawal cognitions. We further modeled global extraversion and cross-cultural motivation as antecedents and explored within-person change in school extraversion as a proximal factor that affects adjustment outcomes. The findings highlight the malleability of contextualized personality, and more importantly, the importance of understanding within-person change in contextualized personality in a cross-cultural adjustment context. The study points to more research that explicate the process of personality change in other contexts.",2015,10/21/22 2:23,10/21/22 2:23,10/21/22 2:23,,,,6,,,Cross-cultural adjustment to the United States,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers,,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/IZCCMPWR/Liu_Huang_2015_Cross-cultural adjustment to the United States.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Appraisal respect encompasses admiration for skills and abilities, and recognition respect reflects treating people in accordance with their human rights. The findings show that extant self-esteem moderates the impact of respect on performance and work effort. A laboratory study using actors to express recognition respect shows that implicit self-esteem moderates recognition respect in a self-verifying manner: People with low implicit self-esteem perform better, whereas those with high implicit self-esteem perform worse when treated with low levels of recognition respect. In contrast, explicit self-esteem moderates appraisal respect in a self-enhancement manner. People with higher explicit self-esteem perform better when they receive low levels of appraisal respect as operationalized by performance feedback. A second study surveys working adults in order to extend the findings to work effort. This study juxtaposes the two types of self-esteem. People with congruent implicit/explicit self-esteem expend more work effort when they experience recognition respect, and those with incongruent self-esteem expend more effort when they experience appraisal respect.

We argue that this predominantly positive view of recipient reactions to helpers is because the literature has not adequately distinguished the outcomes of reactive helping (i.e., assistance provided in response to a request) from those of anticipatory helping (i.e., assistance offered or provided in advance of being asked). We propose that anticipatory helping, especially from helpers with higher status than the recipient, is more self-threatening to recipients than reactive helping; hence, recipients are less likely to accept this help and more likely to lower their evaluations of both the helper’s performance and their relationship with the helper. We find support for these hypotheses with four studies and one supplemental study that use experimental and field methodologies across a range of work contexts and social exchange relationships. Because our findings imply that both peer and higher status employees should withhold anticipatory help, which is impractical and potentially detrimental, we identify how these helpers can instead mitigate the negative effects of anticipatory helping by signaling a more balanced social exchange relationship with the recipient.

Balanced item parcels are sums or averages of individual items consisting of an equal number of regular and reversed items measuring the same construct. When regular and reversed items are combined into parcels, method effects cancel out (assuming that the method effects affecting the regular and reversed items in a parcel are equal in magnitude), and model fit and parameter estimates will no longer be negatively affected by acquiescent responding.

Hierarchical, moderated multiple regression analyzes were used to test the mediation and moderation effects. Findings Results showed that mindfulness reduced destructive deviant behavior and unethical pro-organizational behavior through moral disengagement and the mediation effects were weaker when employees’ perceptions of politics were stronger. Research limitations/implications The results indicate that mindfulness and perceptions of organizational politics combine to have profound impacts on employee unethical behaviors. Organizations seeking to minimize the occurrence of deviance and unethical behaviors may do well to support employee mindfulness and as well as minimizing organizational politics. The findings suggest that the political context has a negative impact on even the behavior of mindful employees.

Yet, past research shows that longer legislated maternity leaves (i.e., 1 year and longer) may unintentionally harm women’s career progress. To address this issue, we first sought to identify one potential mechanism underlying negative effects of longer legislated maternity leaves: others’ lower perceptions of women’s agency. Second, we utilize this knowledge to test interventions that boost others’ perceptions of women’s agency and thus mitigate negative effects of longer legislated maternity leaves. We test our hypotheses in three studies in the context of Canadian maternity leave policies. Specifically, in Study 1, we found that others’ lower perceptions of women’s agency mediated the negative effects of a longer legislated maternity leave, that is, 1 year (vs. shorter, i.e., 1 month maternity leave) on job commitment. In Study 2, we found that providing information about a woman’s agency mitigates the unintended negative effects of a longer legislated maternity leave on job commitment and hireability. In Study 3, we showed that use of a corporate program that enables women to stay in touch with the workplace while on maternity leave (compared to conditions in which no such program was offered; a program was offered but not used by the applicant; and the program was offered, but there was no information about its usage by the applicant) enhances agency perceptions and perceptions of job commitment and hireability.

In Study 2, we replicate these ﬁndings, and in addition, we examine a negative perceptual response to manager care: employee-rated manager role overload. Drawing on perceptual salience research, we propose that the negative relationship between manager care and employee-rated manager role overload is exacerbated in a team environment where employees fail to care for each other (i.e., a weak caring climate).

However, this job-level view overlooks the possibility that engagement may vary across the different tasks within a job and that engagement in one task may influence engagement and performance in a subsequent task. In this article, we develop and test hypotheses based on a task-level view of engagement and the general notion that there is “residual engagement” from a task that carries forward to a subsequent task. We propose that although task engagement (engagement in a specific task that comprises a broader role) positively spills over to influence task engagement and performance in a subsequent task, in part because of the transmission of positive affect, task engagement simultaneously engenders attention residue, which in turn impedes subsequent task engagement and performance. These predictions were supported in a study of 477 task transitions made by 20 crew members aboard The National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Human Exploration Research Analog (Study 1) and in a laboratory study of 346 participants who transitioned between a firefighting task and an assembly task (Study 2).

Yet, recent research has begun to focus on the outcomes of employees engaging in emotion regulation, and surface acting in particular, with coworkers. Given that coworker interactions are qualitatively distinct from those with customers, we build on the emotional labor and emotion regulation literatures to understand why such acts of emotion regulation occur in coworker-based exchanges, and whether there are well-being and social capital costs and/or benefits for doing so. Across 3 complementary studies spanning over 2,500 full-time employees, we adopt a person-centered approach and demonstrate that four distinct profiles of emotion regulation emerge in coworker exchanges: deep actors, nonactors, low actors, and regulators. Further, our results suggest that certain employees are driven to regulate their emotions with coworkers for prosocial reasons (deep actors), whereas others are more driven by impression management motives (regulators). Our results also suggest that while nonactors and deep actors similarly incur well-being benefits (i.e., lower emotional exhaustion and felt inauthenticity), deep actors alone experience social capital gains in the form of higher receipt of help from coworkers, as well as increased goal progress and trust in their coworkers. Combined, our research delineates the motives that drive emotion regulation with coworkers and identifies when such regulatory efforts yield social capital gains for employees.",2020-08,10/21/22 21:23,10/21/22 21:23,10/21/22 21:23,907-929,,8,105,,Journal of Applied Psychology,Are coworkers getting into the act?,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/3ZKQ7P3J/Gabriel et al. - 2020 - Are coworkers getting into the act An examination.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is typically implemented with mobile devices that participants carry with them as they pursue their everyday routines, and that signal participants multiple times a day throughout several days or weeks to report on their momentary experiences and situation. ESM provides insights into shortterm within-person variations and daily-life contexts of experiences, which are essential aspects of human functioning and development. ESM also can ameliorate some of the challenges in lifespan-developmental methodology, in particular those imposed by age-comparative designs. Compared to retrospective or global selfreports, for example, ESM can reduce potential non-equivalence of measures caused by age differences in the susceptibility to retrospective memory biases. Furthermore, ESM maximizes ecological validity compared to studies conducted in artificial laboratory contexts, which is a key concern when different age groups may differentially respond to unfamiliar situations. Despite these strengths, ESM also bears significant challenges related to potential sample selectivity and selective sample attrition, participants’ compliance and diligence, measurement reactivity, and missing responses. In age-comparative research, these challenges may be aggravated if their prevalence varies depending on participants’ age. Applications of ESM in lifespan methodology therefore require carefully addressing each of these challenges when planning, conducting, and analyzing a study, and this article provides practical guidelines for doing so. When adequately applied, experience sampling is a powerful tool in lifespan-developmental methodology, particularly when implemented in long-term longitudinal and cross-sequential designs.",10/24/18,10/21/22 21:30,10/21/22 21:30,10/21/22 21:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Oxford University Press,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,DOI: 10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.013.346,,/Users/corymoore/Zotero/storage/3I7MBQ4T/Riediger and Rauers - 2018 - Experience Sampling in Lifespan Developmental Meth.pdf,,,,,,,,,"Riediger, Michaela; Rauers, Antje",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We review existing research on these topics and present new data to address these concerns. We find that insufficient attention is no more a problem among MTurk samples than among other commonly used convenience or high-quality commercial samples, and that MTurk participants buy into interactive experiments and trust researchers as much as participants in laboratory studies. Furthermore, we find that employing rigorous exclusion methods consistently boosts statistical power without introducing problematic side effects (e.g., substantially biasing the post-exclusion sample), and can thus provide a general solution for dealing with problematic respondents across samples.
